Essential compilation: One of the best compilations to come out in the last few years. track number 25 "falling in love again" by Johnny Moore ended up being played over and over again on my stereo. Great duet singing hauntingly beautiful in the same way as listening to the Everly Brothers harmonize. It's great to have alot of these hard (or even impossible) to find singles on CD. Many of these tracks are not overly reliant on hooks, so they definitely need continued listening to realize just how incredible most of these songs are. But well worth the effort.

Rincewind's a bit of a [[bore]] and hasn't Australia suffered enough?: [[It's]] funny how the character that started the series remains my least favorite recurring figure in Pratchett's [[Discworld]] books. [[Rincewind]] is a one note character whose perpetual cowardice wears a bit more each time he appears. While "Running away, keeps him alive," it also is unbearably predictable. Another difficulty with this one is that the too obvious Australia references read like a Monty Python skit that has gone on for far too long. [[This]] one's a throwaway in the series, for every good laugh there's about 50 pages of plodding along. There is an interesting Pratchett take on evolution and creation that brighten things up temporarily, but this pleasure is buried amidst what is easily one of my least favorite books in the [[series]]. It's rare that [[Pratchett]] writes one with little to [[recommend]] it, but The Last Continent fits that description all too well.

Worthless Junk: [[These]] headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. The inline volume control never did work properly; it always got one side higher than the other. The supposed Noise-Canceling feature is a joke; it only cuts out constant sustained sounds of the same pitch, which means that the only thing they ever blocked out was the whistle on my tea kettle, which is the one thing I would prefer to not have blocked out. After about 4 months of only occasionally usage, one of the speakers stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money.

Pretty good triller with a different twist that you have to watch all the way threw to understand: This movie is much different then normal suspense trillers or mystery thrillers that most of us are use to. Leo does a great acting job and the supporting actors add to the drama and intensity of the film. I have personally watched it 3 times now since I've have bought it a while ago. It took me watching it 3 times to fully understand the whole movie and what the main character meant at the end of the movie. So if you like Martin Scorsese movies then pick this movie up and watch it all the way threw to fully understand the movie and whole plotline of the movie your watching. It is really a good suspense triller and lots of drama. Buy it and make up your own mind about the actors and the plotline because it is a good movie.

Because I [[enjoy]] his music so much, I braved the hefty price believing I must have it.It was a woeful disappointment for me, however. The disc consists of elongated versions of just a handful of Sting tunes set to drum-machine-produced club beats. I'm not into the club scene and actually enjoy Sting for the variety of world beats he incorporates into his music, so this really rubbed a nerve with me. I really didn't need the 3 disco versions of "Desert Rose" that this [[CD]] features.[[This]] [[CD]] is [[gonna]] collect [[dust]].

No, not really: [[The]] title of this CD is misleading in an amazing number of ways. None of the songs are in any way related to rock music, nor, with one exception, are any of the artists. Even calling it a compilation of 60's folk music is a stretch. There are a handful of selections by artists from the early 60's folk scene, but planted among them are songs by a couple of "folk-lite" bands (in the Kingston Trio/PP&M vein), two pop groups, and for some reason, a song by Traffic. I would be fascinated to learn what, in someone's mind, tied these together. Unless you are looking for a specific song, you can skip this one. Amazon sells dozens of other fine collections which [[better]] define both "60's folk" and "the roots of rock".

Excellent Introduction: I heard this author speak about XML and bought the book since he convinced me. Having purchased the book, I understand the excitement. Four introductory chapters eased me into XML while giving enough detail for me to be assured of the feasibility of XML. The next 8 chapters add detail, lots of detail, with sometimes amusing, frequently useful examples. I actually enjoyed reading XML: A Primer instead of just pushing through it to reach the end. I would definitely tell anyone who's interested or simply curious to check this out: it would open doors to organization of documents as well as styles of web design.

Professional-type ironing board, but...: In my opinion, this ironing board is worth the money because it is incredibly stable, solid, and has a large ironing surface. Unfortunately, these traits also make it heavy, unwieldy, and difficult to move and set up. I am a relatively petite woman with arthritic hands, so those things are problems for me. The board is so wide that it is difficult to hold both releases at the same time (to let the legs down)and maintain control of the process. The board generally ends up sort of falling into place, which is not great. The board is also quite a bit heavier to carry and manuver than other boards I've used. On the extras, the rack for the iron and for hanging clothes is very handy (and fits the big iron perfectly), and the stacking rack underneath the board is handy, if you can remember to use it. All in all, I would buy this board again, but it's not perfect, like everything else.

Best instructional book I ever read: This is truly a COMPLETE instructional guide on hunting big bass. I can't believe the author gave away all this information. The book is well worth $50 or more. I wish Mr. Murphy was still around today so I could ask him questions and learn from his expertise. He shows you a step by step process and covers all aspects of big bass fishing. I've read a few other books on fishing, and also other instructional books in other things I'm interested in such as golf, and this is the best book by far. It is so good because it is simple to read, is detailed, has so much good information and is delivered in a way that helps you retain the information. After the first chapter I realized I needed to break out a highlighter and quite honestly, 1/3 of every page in the book is highlighted LOL. Buy this book today if you want to become a better trophy bass angler!

Vey Informative Research about H.D.: [[I]] read this book as part of a graduate project on H.D. It was very informative about the nature of H.[[D]].'s poetry, especially as it concerns encoded language. The comparisons drawn between Sappho's writing and H.D.'s poems show a linear connection between the poets in their subjects, speech and rhythms. H.D.'s images can be understood as a continuation of an ongoing conversation with the ancient Greek poet. H.D.'s interest in palimpsests is another interesting connection and influence in her writing. H.D. was lyrically attuned to Sappho's intent, and many of her poems are enriched by this layer of understanding. [[Collecot]] focuses on several poems in [[depth]] to capture the sense of what [[H]].D. was trying to do with her work.

A Drastic Disappointment: I'm sorry to say this is not one of King's better novels, even though I stuck with it to the end. Here are the pros and cons of the novel. King's story is surprisingly original. I must say this is a new direction for him. The novel contains some interesting plot twists. I liked the "crossword puzzle" theme especially. Rogette Whitmore is a strong, frightening character, the kind you love to hate. And the final paragraphs prove to be an interesting conclusion to the story that surprisingly impressed me. BUT...that's not to say the novel has many drawbacks. The third-person narrative stinks--one minute Mike is a serious literary personality, quoting Maugam and Hardy, but the next he babbles on childishly about erections and breasts. Kyra and Mattie are annoyingly perfect. And, needless to say, the plot seems to drag on forever. BAG OF BONES is sadly a disappointment. It has its faults, but I guess it's good-natured and kind of innocent. It's truly a mixed bag.

In reality, people change, and it isn't always possible to be together forever.

Flash animation made easy: As an intermediate Flash programmer, and one who does not find it easy to learn solely by reading a book, I found this book extremely helpful and easy to understand. I am a 'hands on' person, and learn better thru exercises and simplified instruction, (i.e. "click THIS, then click THAT."). This book offers that type of instruction, yet the subject matter is deep enough to be helpful to any Flash animator. From simple animations to indepth interactivity, this book is excellent and well worth the price.

DOESN'T INCLUDE THE TANK!!!!: I purchased this for our office because i have one at home and really like it. I know that they are also sold as just the faucet so i read the description carefully to make sure this item included both the faucet and the tank. The Technical details and the Product description clearly talk about the features of the tank also. However, after i received it and got only the faucet i looked more closely and the "from the manufacturer" section says its only the faucet!As for the product, the one i have at home is getting close to 5 years old. I did have to replace the old tank when it started leaking but that tank was plastic and i haven't had any problems since i replaced it with the new stainless tank. My [[faucet]] has never stuck open as other people have reported.

George had a good idea but the book really stunk.: At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.

CUBE mostly great throughout: This was a great time. The film jumps right into the story and never lets up. The idea is very fresh and innovative and the complexities of the "cube" were handled first-rate. The only thing that got to me-and not too terribly much, I might add-was the over-the-top acting of one of the cast members. I don't want to name names, but a for most of the film his eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of his head. Over all, this is a pretty great first film for Natali and everyone involved should be proud of the outcome. Cheers for indie sci-fi.

Beyond the Mego dolls (oops -- I mean action figures) ....: Chip Kidd, who also wrote a neat "Batman Animated" coffeetable book on the well-loved and critically acclaimed "Batman: The Animated Series" that debuted in 1992, turns here to the hobby (and serious business, for some) of collecting.He includes his own childhood remembrances of Bat-items, as well as wonderfully quirky photography. This book, full-color throughout, is not a "guide" to the collectibles, as it does not include price values or manufacturers (it does give the year and dimensions for each piece pictured). And it's by no means all-inclusive (hey, not even a third of the "Animated Series" merchandise I own was in there!). Plus, there is an editorial comment on the Andy Warhol Batman piece that's got a bit of an attitude.But all in all, it's a neat celebration of the Bat-phenomenon -- and the Bat-collector, who in our modern times has become quite well-known, too.

I can understand how it's possible for folks to have different opinions about some titles, but really, this game is just horrible on every level.The graphics are poor, and that's in comparison to other initial Wii-released games. The use of the Wii controller is unimaginative. And the gameplay just stinks.

And NOT extras wearing wigs, posing as hippies, as in many Psych-exploitation [[films]] of the period like 'Psych-Out, 'The Trip', 'Wild In The Streets, 'Gas-s-s-s' and others. 'Skidoo' has true 'longhairs' - a genuine snapshot of a certain time & place, never to be repeated ever again.

Not so great at all!: People, the cable merely worked. It is well made and it did transmit the sound signal but the input signal was very low using a Shure SM-58 with a MacBook Pro 17" mid 2010. If you need to record with a microphone, you'll need an external audio interface with a good mic preamp in order to plug the microphone to it. The preamp will increase the mic signal, and you'll be able to get a good sound signal in your recording application.

WARM AND GENTLE GLENN: Glenn Yarbrough brings his warm tenor to a diverse selection of tunes, concentrating in this outing on some of the songwriters of the 60's, including Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, and Buffy Sainte-Marie. Glenn provides fine interpretations of songs such as "Tomorrow Is A Long Time" and "Until It's Time for You To Go." A very worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes Glenn's music.

[[Don't]] waste your money: Luckily I bought this sweeper on sale with a coupon. Otherwise, I would be very upset. This product started out fine: it's cordless and did run well on both carpet and vinyl. But after maybe half a dozen times of using it, it would work for 30 seconds and then the battery would shut down. I had charged the battery fully, so I know it was full of juice when I started. I was just very disappointed with this and frustrated every time I had to use it. Plus, it was too wide to get in the tight spots on my floors and it wouldn't go right up to the edges. I bought a Swiffer Sweep + Vac and couldn't be happier with it. True, it doesn't work on carpet, but I just use my vaccuum cleaner for that anyway. It's much cheaper, cordless, and has a swivel head to get to those hard-to-reach places. I was not impressed with the Shark [[brand]] and probably won't by anything from them again.

Very Sad, but Also Very True: This book is the only biography on Celine Dion that tells the real story. As strong as Queen Celine appears to be, she is in reality very emotionally unstable. As heart-braking as this may be to her fans, it does make her seem like more of a real person. The book did not cause me to dislike Celine, and really did not bash her very much at all. I still think that Celine has the most beautiful voice that I have ever heard, and my opinions of her have remained the same. If you do not want to know who Celine really is and what she has to deal with every day, do not read this book. If you are interested, this biography contains the most truth of any out there.

A delightful twist on an old favorite: My four year old daughter adores this book. Already a huge fan of the classic Cinderella story, she found this book at the library and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase a copy for our own collection. The illustrations are bright, colorful and clever. The story is long enough to hold the interest of a child who is ready to move beyond single-sentence storytelling, yet not so long that it takes forever to finish the book (always a plus if you have a child that is always trying to negotiate for just one more book before bedtime).

As an American who's been living in Italy for nearly 12 years, I found very little I could relate to from my own experience. I was horrified at the plotting to poison the neighbors' dog (who was sadly mistreated), for instance. While his descriptions of certain frustrating aspects of contemporary Italian bureaucracy, housing, etc. are spot-on, unlike other reviewers I often found his tone to be patronizing towards the Italians he encounters in everyday life. An Italian friend, fluent in English, loaned me this book without giving me any hints as to what she thought of it; after I'd finished, she was relieved to find that I was as taken aback as she was at his characterization of his adopted country. "I would be terribly upset if every expat felt this way about Italy!" she told me. [[As]] much as [[I]] have [[enjoyed]] his fiction, Tim Parks' nonfiction left me cold.

As she grew, she loved being on her tummy with the colorful mat, especially the crinkling leaf. The attached toys were excellent themselves and I used them to clip onto her carseat and crib. Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat.My only criticism is of the "musical" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted. ALso, the sun-mirror comes off easily and is hard to prop up.Again, this is well worth it and a well designed toy for any infant.

Great book!: This is a real funny book. It can make you laugh or very upset. It will stay with you forever. Peter, a nine year old boy has a three year old brother that causes him many problems. Fudge is a cute little boy, but he can be a little monster too. His parents love him and although they know he misbehaves, they excuse him because he is little and does not know what he is doing. Peter on the other hand is the good son and they are always looking up to him to take care of his little brother.The writer does a very good job at describing how little kids this age feel when they have a sibling that gets all the attention and they get away with everything simply because they are small and dont know what they are doing.

Don't waste your money!!!: We tried this product on my 5 year old who has a rather large (1 cm) wart on the heel of her foot. She was very brave in letting us scrape the dead skin off the wart (a very important step)--a few times until it bleed. We always held the freeze-away tip for at least 40 seconds and then also went around the edges of the wart w/the applicator for a bit (a physician gave us this tip). After 9 treatments the wart is only minimally smaller. We should have just went to the dr. to begin with! We have had success in the past using Compound W and duct tape but nothing would stick to my daughter's foot at the location of the wart. So, unless your wart in tiny, [[save]] your [[money]]!

The music was intoxicating, relaxing, and perplexing, and I loved every second of it. Now, with more recent releases, Porcupine Tree has been taking a more rock oriented aproach with mixed results... until this. This album has everything. It has intricate instrumentals, rhythm changes, hard guitar meat, acoustic passages and still remains to be experimental and psychedelic. Wilson's vocals have always been fantastic, but here they are showcased better than ever on this album. Most of this album (though not all) has a dark tone, which I think suits them perfectly.

best western ever: Kevin Costner doesn't get credit for being as good of an actor as he really is. It's nice to be able to see Warner Bros. release a film in the Western genre that, for once, doesn't have anything to do with Clint Eastwood. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in "Tombstone" wasn't nearly as good as the one in this edition. I don't own the Digital Video Disc yet, so I'm not sure if I read something correctly which said that the actual three-hour feature is split onto two discs. I really hope it isn't.If you enjoy this biography of Earp, it won't seem like three hours. I have ADD and I can still sit through it.

The examples of grammar are not as good as they could be. But, then again, you're supposed to already know your grammar before using this book!

It has extremely disturbing images related in a casual, flippant manner. Indeed, Westlake seems to be more or less advocating MURDER as a means of advancing one's career, maintaining one's lifestyle. Or, as he puts it, "the end justifies the means".

Meh: Honestly, in the last...i felt there were 2 solid songs that capture my attention. it was not something that i would listen to, all the way through. this cd is basically the same feeling. sure they belt it out sometimes but the fact is, both albums combined i cant tell which song is which, because they all start the same, they all end the same, the riffs are fairly similar, falling up is a semi good band, but they have no diversity is their writing what-so-ever. Its the same old thing over and over. there are two songs that chourses are the same from the first album and this album. the versitility is lacking and substance is just not there, it sounds over produced, and not so much that raw rock feel that the first album had. hope to hear some better work in the future from these guys. next time try writing a song that isnt in Dropped-D.

Best cookbook I have ever tried: What can I say. I am not a very good cook. In fact I burn water. When I tried this cookbook I found not only were the recipes easy to follow, but they resulting meal did look like the picture. It's the only cookbook I use now and I have lost weight using it (I don't exercise either). One of the best recipies is the creamy cauliflower - but if you don't like cauliflower I use broccoli, corn, carrot, green beans or all mixed and it is the best and only way I will eat my vegges from now on. If you like rice and kidney beans my favourite recipe is Mexican Rice cassarole - to die for. Best part about this is I can [[cook]] and no longer burn water.

The best creme ever...: If you want a totally hydrating creme, Burt's bees is the only one to use. I am fair complexioned and my skin, as I grow older, has a tendency toward dryness. I've used all the standard brands, but none have been as beneficial as this particular creme - even those in the Burt's Bees line and many whose cost is double and even triple. I use it as a day and night creme and my skin glows after I apply it. It has a fine texture, is soft, and melts into your skin. Before I tried this particular forumla, I had a medicine chest full of useless face cremes that I used on my arms & legs after a workout. For me, Burt's Bees Beeswax Moisturizing Night Creme the best creme ever.

Good Show, Bad Packaging: I love the Outer Limits show, along with Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond and all of the old scifi shows! Having these shows to watch whenever I feel like it is wonderful! My complaint is with the packaging. The discs are 2 sided and aren't labeled so you'll have to squint to see the tiny writing on the inner part of the disc to figure out which disc you have in hand and if it's side A or B. This might sound easy but trust me, this writing is tiny! And whatever you do, don't mix up your discs!! You'll go into the outer limits trying to figure them out!You know how you're sitting around and you think of a particluar show and want to watch it? You can do just that with this movie set, but it won't be easy finding which disc and which side.All in all, I'm thrilled to have these episodes to watch at will, I'm just not happy at all with the way the discs were made or how they're presented.If you're a fan like me, it's worth it ... but plan to grit your teeth here and there!

Conventional mid-70s hard rock: Bad Company's self titled debut is still their best studio album. Unfortunately, it never achieves the mastery that lead singer Paul Rodgers's previous band Free did on the brilliant "Fire and Water." This album is a fine collection of good but not spectacular hard rock songs. The title song "Bad Company," the hit single "Can't Get Enough" and "Ready For Love" are probably the best of the batch, with "Seagull" trailing along close behind. Any fan of 70s rock will probably find plenty here to keep them content.

There are much better titles available: Half of the book is a history of several value investors. But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did. Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves. The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies. Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company). I recommend instead "The Intelligent Investor" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig. It lives up to Buffett's praise of "...by far the best book about investing ever written."

When placed in the charger, the charge light would illuminate but, instead of turning green when the charge is complete, the light would just go out. When I tried the battery in the camera - nothing.

set yourself onto this album.: 'Set Yourself on Fire' is a great new release from Stars. With poignant lyrics, and a myriad of melodies interlacing on each track, this album is a delight for the ears. Some of the most heart-felt songwriting I've heard in a long time dominates each song; an important feature in great music that has gone so far overlooked in recent years. Of note, the opener, 'Your Ex-Lover is Dead' begins this album on such a breathtaking note, that it is hard not to keep listening. Stars bring to 'Set Yourself on Fire' a unique sound that showcases the talent of this group, while paying homage to the je ne sais quoi that is Montreal. Together with the Arcade Fire, Stars are producing some of the best Canadian music at the moment. This is a great album, and should not be missed. A best pick for this year, for sure. [[But]] this album!

Good toddler book, sweet and educational: My 16-month-old son is intrigued by this book. He is still nursing, and he didn't realize that other animals nurse, too. It is a sweet, educational book that has become a bedtime favorite (followed by nightie nursing, of course).My one complaint: the illustrations, while colorful, lack detail. I would prefer that they show animal udders, etc. And the human baby on the last page appears to have a hunchback!

Nice product, use it for the baby area: I think this product is great, but who knows, since I don't have superman eyesights to be able to see if it's actually killing the germs or not. I've been using it on my cutting board and knives.Lastly you can't make your own spray by mixing with water and chlorine. The mixture that we make at home becomes unstable after a few days and will loose the ability to kill germs. I'm not sure exactly what clorox is using in order to make this spray stable and effective. [[Clorox]] [[advertised]] it "as gentle as water", the only explanation is to have a balance pH in order to be "as gentle as water".

Pleasantly Surprised...: I killed my first deer today! I have had this knife for 2 or so years and never used it for skinning or gutting anything until today. I was quite impressed with how easy it made gutting the deer, especially for a total newbie, and the skinning aspect was great as well. The only con I can think of was that partway through skinning the deer I had to re-hone the blade as it was getting pretty dull. But for <$15 this was a great knife to have on hand and I would recommend it to anybody looking for something of this genre.

scifi classic, redux: I read this last in the summer of 1985, as required summer reading for school. It's intended mostly as an exploration of the ideas of racial purity, vs. evolution and mutation, using the characters (humans who have the mutant ability of telepathy) as the exploration vehicle. The story is set in Labrador, in Canada, following what looks like a rather destructive nuclear war, with the society that survives having some rather puritanical religious views on genetic purity. Back when I first read the book, I took the story as being rather one-sided, in favour of the mutants, but now I read it as more evenly balanced. John Windham was one of my favorite authors, back in the early 1980s, and I am a big fan of The Day of the Triffids, which I re-read back in [[2004]].

Works as expected: I ordered a hitch with the install kit. Item arrived on-time, and at the time I ordered, this was the cheapest price on the internet. I had it delivered to my auto mechanic who installed this in the truck for me. The only complaint is that the bolt holding the head to the frame was missing. A quick call to Reese and it arrived the next day in the mail. Very happy with this product.The slider on the hitch is great when maneuvering the trailer into tight corners. You can easily slide the hitch back away from the cab, allowing for an almost 90 degree turn. With the flip of a bar, the hitch will slide back to the towing position, allowing the weight to sit over your axels when driving down the road.

I hardly ever get a dropped call, 2. It is thin enough to rest in my front pants pocket without feeling like I've got a hummer in there. 3. The body is tough and seems like it will last a good long time. 4. no antenna sticking out, need I say more? 5. I can see the screen-all the time. 6. menu is easy to navigate. 7. The camera works great in a pinch. If I wanted to take "real" pictures, I would have a "real" camera with me. So, all in all, it does what it should without any major annoyances. Could they improve it? Yep, and they will, but for now, I'm happy to have a small, light, easy to use phone that does most things pretty well.

If you ask me, it's quite typical and overtop. What's been done in Bring It On is pretty much done again on Stick It. All the characters are pretty much the preppy, bitchy sorority girl who all of a sudden wants to prove something by doing gymnastics. The one liners are the same, the "rebellion" part gets old pretty quick. They try to be funny, but it's just not. If a movie like this is your thing, go for it.

A Great Opera -- a slightly disappointing Release: Jenufa -- Leos Janacek's "breakout" composition -- had a long and in some ways turgid performance history. The present recording, using the "original" score (before major revisions by the composer in the 1920s) is welcome if only for the ability to compare Janacek's original intention with his later reflections and alterations. Having said that, the audio quality lacks immediacy and presence and the otherwise excellent production values are ultimately hindered by the lackluster sound. Indeed, after viewing this DVD I immediately took out the MacKerras Jenufa recording (Elizabeth Soderstrum) to remind me just exactly how this magnificent opera is supposed to "sound." It's a pity that there is not another DVD available; this opera deserves the widest possible audience.

A peek inside the process.: First thing's first, "Homespun" is an album of demos for "Apple Venus". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, "Skylarking" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for "Apple Venus". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places ("Frivolous Tonight") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts "River of Orchids" and "Green Man".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original ("Knights in Shining Karma"), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out "Apple Venus", it's a fine record.

Good book for those new to Web Services: As a title, Java Web Services Architecture hits the nail on the head. Within the book's pages, the authors succeed in clarifying the tedious technical arcana surrounding the architecture of service-oriented distributed computing. They manage to frame this in a context that's meaningful, even inspirational, to IT developers and tech-savvy business strategists.One of the more positive aspects of this book is the authors understand that web services can be written in languages other than English. The outsourcing company that is in the process of stealing my job uses this book extensively. Oh well, I will have something to read while on the unemployment line.

The Jain Awstin Book Club: [[I'm]] wondering if the author meant to write about the lesser-known author Jain Awstin, who creates 2-dimensional characters and plots that begin and end somewhere in the middle of the action. This book is a crushing disappointment because I don't think ANYONE buys a book called The Jane Austen Book Club without hoping for something tying it to Jane Austen. The characters are boring, poorly-developed, and annoyingly chick-lit (wow, a tough, lesbian character who speaks her mind and dresses a bit over-the-top? How unique.). I think the only thing I enjoyed about this book were the very few quotes from JA's books. Not that this book is about Jane Austen. [[Because]] it's not.

Honest narrative of a difficult story: This is a difficult story to tell, mainly because reality is much less dramatic than the myth surrounding this episode, especially after the Spielberg movie. Firstly, most of the initial assassinations in the wake of Munich were low-level logistical support people who probably were not even involved in the original massacre. On balance, aside from Ali Hassan Salameh, the goal of revenge, as the title "Striking Back" suggests, was never really achieved (and even that his involvement disputed by some of Klein's sources). I suppose that is a bitter reality of any anti-terrorist effort. However, the book really loses its way after the "Spring of Youth" operation in Beirut, as the original story line of punishing the perpetrators of Munich fades into the more humdrum and bloody story of tit-for-tat killings after attacks. Once again, this is probably not the author's fault but rather a testament to the honesty with which a difficult story is told.

Good Enough To Finish: This is the first of Carol Goodman's books I have ever read, and the cover pages notes this is a debut novel. I wouldn't classify it "gothic" and it probably should be in the "mystery" section however, it was good enough to finish. I have to agree with other reviewers - I definately figured it out pretty early in the book, both the "who" of who dunnit, and the "who" of who she was with May Day. With that said, the book was definately a good read, too much latin, yet I did want to see how it ended. The ending was a little rushed, but satisfying. I will be curious to see how Ms Goodman's other novels compare.

Comprendido Time Flop: Of the dozen or so albums Deutsch Nepal has put out, this is by far the most yawn-worthy and uninspired. If they were trying to do something intelligent with this album, it must have involved giving the listener a dull headache, and you don't need this album for that (you can punch yourself in the face as many times as you want completely for free). Deutsch Nepal is capable of good music, and for their best work I would suggest tracking down a copy of "Deflagration of Hell" (available as a 2003 reissue), "Tolerance", or the limited edition "Only Silence Among the Filthy," in that order. Even then, though, I probably would still only recommend investing the effort of such a quest to the most die-hard of rythmic and industrial noise fans.

this film lacks the oxygen to make it a really good thriller: This film has an intense premise and the thriller aspects of it should have a high pace, but the psychological torments just don't add up. Adrien Brody is superb and creepy as the Houdini killer. At times the film feels made-for-TV rather than a true portrayal of the horror of this drama. Henry (played by Brody) asks the female detective (played by Maura Tierney) is she knows what's it's like being clever. That seems to be the problem with this film - it tries to be clever rather than to follow the logistical progression of its own storyline.

(vincent perez speaks decent spanish--but his english is tinged with a french accent while the rest of the family speaks english with a spanish accent!) the actors make a valiant attempt at salvaging the movie, but the result is a cheesy, overblown, wannabe epic. (it's almost painful to watch mary and francisco interact.) while the scenery is gorgeous, there are other films with far better stories, character development, and dialogue. try belle epoque (with ariadna gil and penelope cruz) or le bossu (with vincent perez) for a better representation of these actors' talents.

I replaced the battery maybe three times. I wore this watch daily and beat the heck out of it, replacing only the battery and the band. I finally even put a stainless steel band on it to make it look a little more "civilized." True, during its last 6 months or so, it started to stop for a few minutes once in a while.

It really doesn't have a beat to which you can move naturally.2) There is no adequate warm-up or cool-down.3) The DVD is in a small fitted case, no bigger than the dvd, which makes it hard to store with other DVDs.If you're looking for a good quick workout, I'd recommend the following two from her Walk Away the Pounds series: 1) Power Mile; 2) Get Up and Get Started (I have this on DVD with the two-mile High Calorie Burn).

Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet.

Diana Ross/ Beyonce Knowles: This could have been a classic and a mile stone for the girls, but once again the song is overpowered with Beyonces vocals. First of all the song, though catchy, is too repetitive and too obivious. First Beyonce sings her verse then Kelly and then Michelle. What would have made the song more interesting and more of a classic, is to have Michelle sing the whole song. Why Not!!! Remember when TLC had Chilli on the lead vocal on 'No Scrubs', it was instantly a classic. Beacause TLC fans were used to hearing T-Boz in the lead this raised the bar for TLC and gave their fans something new. How refreshing would it be to let the othe members of the group have there moment to shine?

a...coffee coaster: Anarchy online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game set on a fictional planet in the distant future. It has an evolving storyline that uses the classic rebels verses the establishment theme. There is no magic in the game. The traditional magic element is replaced by almost equally mystical use of nano-technology. Players can assume the roles of spies, soldiers, doctors, nano-technologists and other various futuristic professions.The graphics are lovely and it has fabulous sound effects. There are no zones (ala Everquest) except for entering apartments, cities and quests. THe interface is... usable...The only problem is that the entire experience left me cold. This game is so lovely that it was almost sterile. Where is its heart and soul?If you love the future and need a switch from the previous MMORPG's on the market try this game. I, in the meantime, will sadly set my coffee cup down on my new...coffee coaster and wait for the next big thing.Singerspell

This no longer fits him but it fits my young argus monitor pretty well, but i will never trust this on him. I think the harness was orginally meant for having you lizard on your SHOULDER just beacasue how short the string is and how the string is so fat and heavy, but for a good reason.

OK, but not meant as a leash.: This is a great leash for a smaller lizard, I had originally bought this for my bearded dragon, which was great untill he grew a little bigger. This no longer fits him but it fits my young argus monitor pretty well, but i will never trust this on him. I think the harness was orginally meant for having you lizard on your SHOULDER just beacasue how short the string is and how the string is so fat and heavy, but for a good reason.

Every opinion counts for something: I regret giving this author one star here, because I'm sure this kind of writing appeals to some people. Just not to me. He's obviously a great writer, very descriptive writer, but my problem was I didn't care about anything in here. He didn't create a world or a vision that drew me in. For me he just created chaos, a lack of storyline and an ending that left me angry over wasting my time. I believe storyline and characters are the crucial two ingredients, without which a novel might someday be called great literature, but will never make a great movie. In this case, he created a world where a plague has hit. This world of the newly dead are all peopling this book as long as there are still people living who can remember them. But this peopling of the dead reads as though these dead people exist exactly the same as if they were still living. You might [[enjoy]] his representation of this, but I did not.

Uhhh..........it just DOESN'T WORK!: At first i liked it because it met my simple needs-a simple mp3 player that played some songs i like so i dont have to burn a bunch of cds. But, it kept having problems from the getgo. When i put my smartmedia card in, it just froze and the only way to turn it on or off, was to take the card and the battery out before trying it again. Also, it can freze at random times too and i have to take the battery out. You also have to hold the on button for literaly 5 seconds! And it only plays mp3, so i have to downloade free softwear to convert wma or wav to mp3. If this unit just worked how its supposed to it would be good for money, but it doesnt. I mean, the features are pretty good for such a cheap mp3 player but is just that-CHEAP! So right now i curently cant get it to turn on at all, so im gunna try and return it.PLEASE LISTEN AND DONT BUY IT. I DIDNT WHEN OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND LOOK WHAT HAPPEND!

Meh: I was a big fan of the show, and I enjoyed the first movie.I was not a big fan of this movie though. I did not like the way it portrayed Big and Carrie's marriage. Carrie is upset that they don't go out to fancy restaurants all the time. When Big comes home with takeout she gets upset. I just can't believe how much money is being tossed around without a second thought. Eating out, getting takeout every day, that's so expensive, especially in NYC. And I hated Carrie's reaction to Big wanting to relax at home. Not every day has to be spent out partying and getting drunk. What's wrong with cuddling on the couch? It doesn't mean you're in a rut, or that you're boring as she implies. And Big asking to spend 2 days apart every week? for me that would be the end of the marriage

Dolby's best effort, bar none: This album is what Dolby fans live for, pure energy! Thomas Dolby moves this album through a series of changes that takes each song and pushes the energy level up a notch, in succession, the album builds and builds, bringing a climax that starts at the beginning and holds you there with a majority of the album. KEYS TO FERRARI is fun as he pulls you into the driver's seat and tells you what he REALLY thinks. HOT SAUCE is fun, bringing the level up yet again, its zesty and has a funk to it that will move even those who dare not dance in public. Dolby does himself justice with this album, as it looks as though he took all that musicality that flows through his body and put it into something that is difficult to replicate. For anyone who has or has not heard Dolby, THIS IS THE ALBUM TO BUY. If it hooks you, then get the others, but this is where to start.

Not much of a legacy: What a slow, dull, plodding book!For what it's worth, and that ain't much, the story concerns Indy's adventures in the American deserts, bookended by French mountains and Italian streets, as he hunts down a Unicorn horn that has magical powers. Yes, they really have sunk THAT low when trying to think of enchanting MacGuffins for our hero to go after.There are double crosses, and some extremely unexciting 'action' scenes, and a whole load of nothing else. I often think that Rob MacGregor's Indy stories have about 10 pages worth of mileage that he e-x-p-a-n-d-s to 300 or so with lots of filler and padded dialogue. It's such an infuriatingly boring read. The high-flying escapades we're used to seeing in the movies is a million miles from this cure for insomnia.For absolute hardcore Indy fans only, and even they won't enjoy it.

It was only happening across a review of the film that I decided to get the DVD. What a suprise! Rudy is one of those movies that inspired me. A truly wonderful, moving story, beautifully told. Even more amazing is the fact that it is based on a true story!As for the DVD itself, I was very pleased with the sound and video quality. Anamorphic video is sharp and saturated, and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is stirring and makes good use of the surround speakers. The extras on the disc are good (a commentary track would have been a nice addition), but the featurettes, featuring interviews with the real Rudy are teriffic.Highly reccomended

Pointless game, too simple and you will ask yourself why?: A pointless game with the most basic gameplay, two tops going at it until one stops spinning or is knocked out of the stadium. You do this throughout the whole game and gets really repetitive. Most of the special beast that your beyblade can have are carbon copies of the other ones and have almost the same animation every time you do the attack. This game is just a cash in to the toy line and you'll have more fun with the actual beyblade and friends to play with them then this game. Don't Buy!If you do buy it then have fun wasting your money.

The [[best]] portable chess player around: Chessmaster for Gameboy has the same chess engine as the PC and Mac versions. I play it all the time, keeping my game sharp, and improving my skills. It's the best alternative when there's no computer access or nobody to play. I take it travelling with me and anytime I know I'll be stuck someplace waiting. And people don't look at you funny when they find out it's chess instead of Donkey Kong or Pac-Man!

Beautiful Music: I had never heard Nicole sing before, but was driving my car in an area where I did not know any of the radio stations, and was immediately captured by her version of Emmanuel. I listened to the radio station for 30 minutes waiting to hear a phone number, and when I did I called them to find out who the artist was. I am not typically an emotional person, but her voice was so beautiful I started crying during the song. I can't wait to hear the entire CD.

Is there a better book to demonstrate that literature written by dead white males can be completely captivating, extraordinarily wise about the ways of the world, wonderfully revealing of of human nature, instructive of history in a way a standard text rarely is, exquisitely written, and fully capable of instilling a love of literature to last a lifetime?I suppose the book is too French (the American educational system will admit a Fijian sooner than it will a Frenchman). And, yes, it has lots of sex. But making young minds fondle Catcher in the Rye when Bel Ami is about is simply criminal. Enjoy.

I live in NYC, so I have to pack it up and send it to California - the only center in the USA that Sanyo refers to handle the unit?I spoke to the repair center and the cost would be $25 for a diagnosis, plus $40 for labor, plus shipping costs: $65+ to replace a tiny battery! Even the person I spoke to at the repair center thought it was economically ridiculous to send the unit to them just to replace the battery, and she tried to dissuade me from doing it.Seriously, you have to disassemble the unit in order to get to the front panel, then disassemble the electronic front panel to get to the battery. I kid you not. Trust me, it ain't easy - and you risk breaking something in the process. Unless you feel comfortable performing brain surgery, stay away from this unit![[Sanyo]] - very, very, stupid.

His kind is becoming extinct as well as hunted and after his entire family is murdered he undergoes a self-quest to find answers to his many questions on dragon life. Along the way he meets very interesting people and animals. It is amazing how close the reader comes to this unusual hero. You would never think it considering the menu choices, but it happens.

Big-House On Haunted Hill...: A group of documentary film-makers venture into an abandoned prison, only to find themselves besieged by a group of desperate criminals. If that weren't bad enough, the place is haunted to boot! Yep, the ghosts of murdered inmates-past roam the halls, waiting for unsuspecting college kids and jewel thieves to mutilate. DEATH ROW is a goofy, rather dull spooker, with the typical victims and the ghouls who love them. Actually, there are some well-done gore fx, which are worth an extra star. However, I just didn't find this one to be all that chilling, original, or fun. The usually reliable Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) was pretty lame as the main badguy, the ghostly inmates look ridiculous for the most part, and the other characters are pure wood-products. The basic story is an ancient one that's been done a zillion times before in (better) films like HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, DEAD BIRDS, SCARECROWS, BELOW, etc., and didn't need another re-tread...

Really disappointing: For something this fanciful to work, every element, from the characters to the plot to the setting, has to contribute to the suspension of disbelief. None of this took place. The characters were cardboard, the plot meandered, the background was hazy. I will still try to slog through it just because I always try to finish books, but this one's going to take me a while. Sorry, didn't work for me.A note on how I read, and how I review:When they begin to bore me, or I stop believing in the world the writer is attempting to create, I stop reading and move on to something else. There are so many books, and so little time, that it's simply not worth spending time on books that aren't getting the job done. If the book isn't holding your interest, why bother?
