Complete Disappointment: Bought the item ...No instructions ... Used my imagination and what I have read on several forums ... Placed the Receiver dirctly in front of the Satellite receiver box, about three inches away from the box infra-red eye ...Placed the sender in a room on the ground floor, about 50 feet away with walls and stairway in between .. Pointed the remote and nothing happened ...Took the sender to the room where the Receiver unit was, placed it about four feet away from the Receiver unit and tried changing channels in the same room ...after many, many and I mean many tries (about one hour time), I was able to change one channel ...then nothing more .. I tried attaching the enclosed eye to the infra-red eye of the box ..but that did not improve anything!My opinion and rating: It is a complete waste of money and time to buy this product. There is no way I would recommend anyone to buy it.

Rincewind's a [[bit]] of a [[bore]] and hasn't Australia [[suffered]] [[enough]]?: It's [[funny]] how the character that started the series remains my least favorite recurring figure in Pratchett's Discworld books. Rincewind is a one note character whose perpetual cowardice wears a bit more each time he appears. While "Running away, keeps him alive," it also is unbearably predictable. Another difficulty with this one is that the too obvious Australia references read like a Monty Python skit that has gone on for far too long. This one's a throwaway in the series, for every good laugh there's about 50 pages of plodding along. There is an interesting Pratchett take on evolution and creation that brighten things up temporarily, but this pleasure is buried amidst what is easily one of my least favorite books in the series. It's rare that Pratchett writes one with little to recommend it, but The Last Continent fits that description all too well.

Worthless Junk: These headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. The inline volume control never did work properly; it always got one side higher than the other. The supposed Noise-Canceling feature is a joke; it only cuts out constant sustained sounds of the same pitch, which means that the only thing they ever blocked out was the whistle on my tea kettle, which is the one thing I would prefer to not have blocked out. After about 4 months of only occasionally usage, one of the speakers stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money.

Pretty good triller with a different twist that you have to watch all the way threw to understand: This movie is much different then normal suspense trillers or mystery thrillers that most of us are use to. Leo does a great acting job and the supporting actors add to the drama and intensity of the film. I have personally watched it 3 times now since I've have bought it a while ago. It took me watching it 3 times to fully understand the whole movie and what the main character meant at the end of the movie. So if you like Martin Scorsese movies then pick this movie up and watch it all the way threw to fully understand the movie and whole plotline of the movie your watching. It is really a good suspense triller and lots of drama. Buy it and make up your own mind about the actors and the plotline because it is a good movie.

He had wanted this game for several months but I was'nt sure he'd like it as much as he wanted it but it was one of those games that I was wrong about- He loves it! I have to admit it is really a fun game. The bowling pens shake and talk to you as you play and they say funny, cute phrases. My little boy who is almost 4 can set the game up him self and play it without anyone else or if he wants we can play with him. I like games that he can understand and be able to play without having a second player all the time. It makes this game even more a good purchase because being an only child there is'nt many games that are like this. He loves this game and still plays it a lot even 3 1/2 months later.

Because I [[enjoy]] his music so much, I braved the hefty price believing I must have it.It was a woeful disappointment for me, however. The disc consists of elongated versions of just a handful of Sting tunes set to drum-machine-produced club beats. I'm not into the club scene and actually enjoy Sting for the variety of world beats he incorporates into his music, so this really rubbed a [[nerve]] with me. I really didn't need the 3 disco versions of "Desert Rose" that this CD features.This CD is gonna collect dust.

No, not [[really]]: The title of this CD is [[misleading]] in an amazing number of ways. None of the songs are in any way related to rock music, nor, with one exception, are any of the artists. Even calling it a compilation of 60's folk music is a stretch. There are a handful of selections by artists from the early 60's folk scene, but planted among them are songs by a couple of "folk-lite" bands (in the Kingston Trio/PP&M vein), two pop groups, and for some reason, a song by Traffic. I would be fascinated to learn what, in someone's mind, tied these together. Unless you are looking for a specific song, you can skip this one. Amazon sells dozens of other fine collections which better define both "60's folk" and "the roots of rock".

Don't quit your day job Jennifer!: I believe Jennifer Lopez is a talented actress but she doesn't have strong enough vocals to become a real singer. Her videos are hip and cool and are possibly the reason people are going to buy her CD but I think if you carefully listen to her, you can tell she's really trying. I caught her rendition of "If you had my love" on the Letterman and it was no wonder the backup singers were singing louder than her. I think Jennifer should seriously reconsider acting because it's one profession in which she doesn't have to try so hard.

Four introductory chapters eased me into XML while giving enough detail for me to be assured of the feasibility of XML. The next 8 chapters add detail, lots of detail, with sometimes amusing, frequently useful examples. I actually enjoyed reading XML: A Primer instead of just pushing through it to reach the end. I would definitely tell anyone who's interested or simply curious to check this out: it would open doors to organization of documents as well as styles of web design.

If you want to read better work to grow as a person, read anything written by Mariane Williamson or attend any of the courses offered by landmark education. This book is kinder garden. However, I am happy that sales of this book are is doing well since this book is a good starting point for people who have never done any self-improvement work or reading.I wonder why Oprah did not push Marianne Williamson's work instead since she is one of her friends at XM radio.

Professional-type ironing board, but...: In my opinion, this ironing board is worth the money because it is incredibly stable, solid, and has a large ironing surface. Unfortunately, these traits also make it heavy, unwieldy, and difficult to move and set up. I am a relatively petite woman with arthritic hands, so those things are problems for me. The board is so wide that it is difficult to hold both releases at the same time (to let the legs down)and maintain control of the process. The board generally ends up sort of falling into place, which is not great. The board is also quite a bit heavier to carry and manuver than other boards I've [[used]]. On the extras, the rack for the iron and for hanging clothes is very handy (and fits the big iron perfectly), and the stacking rack underneath the board is handy, if you can remember to use it. All in all, I would buy this board again, but it's not perfect, like everything else.

The book is well worth $50 or more. I wish Mr. Murphy was still around today so I could ask him questions and learn from his expertise. He shows you a step by step process and covers all aspects of big bass fishing. I've read a few other books on fishing, and also other instructional books in other things I'm interested in such as golf, and this is the best book by far. It is so good because it is simple to read, is detailed, has so much good information and is delivered in a way that helps you retain the information.

Solid mature album with many musical influences: 3Canal has fulfilled the promise that was shown in Book of Blue in 1997. Musically, 3 Canal used live instrumentation to bring an edge and authenticity to the sound of the album, and took on the challenge of expressing the versatility of the rapso flow over a diverse range of rhythms from calypso and the pulsating jab jab rhythm to Latin, funk, groove, ambient, drum & bass and dance influences.And these guys can really SING!I particularly like "Peace Chant" and "I Believe".This cd is definitely worth buying.

[[A]] Drastic [[Disappointment]]: I'm [[sorry]] to say this is not [[one]] of King's better novels, even though [[I]] stuck with it to the end. Here are the pros and cons of the [[novel]]. King's story is surprisingly original. I must say this is a new direction for him. The [[novel]] contains some interesting plot twists. I liked the "crossword puzzle" theme especially. Rogette Whitmore is a strong, frightening character, the kind you love to hate. And the final paragraphs prove to be an interesting conclusion to the story that surprisingly impressed me. BUT...that's not to say the novel has many drawbacks.

[[Great]] book for the most [[part]]: I am in a situation very simiar to that of the author - in a long-term live-in relationship and we've just decided to get married. This book addresses SO MANY of the things that've been bugging me. For example: many marriages end in divorce, how can we be sure this one will last? In all actuallity, no one really knows, because I'm sure just about everyone who gets married truly believes it will be forever. In reality, people change, and it isn't always possible to be together forever. It helps so much just to know other's have struggled with the same issues.The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the book goes off on some weird tangents that didn't flow too well. The transitions weren't smooth and I was confused as to why they were included.Overall, very good book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is in a similar situation themselves.

I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.

First game for the Wii that I've regretted buying: I decided to buy the game based on the very positive reviews I read here, and now I'm starting to wonder if Activision is seeding reviews. I can understand how it's possible for folks to have different opinions about some titles, but really, this game is just horrible on every level.The graphics are poor, and that's in comparison to other initial Wii-released games. The use of the Wii controller is unimaginative. And the gameplay just stinks. To top off a lousy game, the cut scene quips between races are so insipid that I can't help but feel a little offended that any game developer would think that I--or anyone else--would actually be amused by the junk.

ONE OVERLOOKED MERIT NOT MENTIONED IN ANY REVIEW: Except for 'Revolution' (a 1968 Documentary - NOT! on DVD), 'Skidoo' has actual *real* hippies from the 'heart' of the world of Flower Power & Peace and Love: San Francisco, California. And NOT extras wearing wigs, posing as hippies, as in many Psych-exploitation films of the period like 'Psych-Out, 'The Trip', 'Wild In The Streets, 'Gas-s-s-s' and others. 'Skidoo' has true 'longhairs' - a genuine snapshot of a certain time & place, never to be repeated ever again. So no matter how "bad" or "good" this movie is, it does have this one distinction that I've never seen mentioned in any of the (extremely contrasting) reviews.P.S. Another overlooked item - in the SINGING! credits at the end of the film, STONE COUNTRY is credited as "Themselves". They recorded one very good, self-titled album in Hollywood in 1968 on the RCA label and were (of course) the token group for the movie. Guess which label released the soundtrack of 'Skidoo'? Yes, RCA.

Well-organized, informative, and accessible to all.: The Great Lakes region has some good plant books already in use, noteably Plants of the Chicago Region, the flora bible for many. As a practicing wetland professional I am always on the lookout for references that make my life easier. This book really fits the need, while remaining accessible to non-professionals. By providing wetland habitat descriptions, as well as solid information on each family and species, the book really adds to the discussion of the Great Lakes flora. Illustrations in the book are detailed enough to serve as a diagnostic tool, enabling the careful reader to separate similar species readily by eye, as well as by technical detail, a feature lacking in some other regional plant reference books.

I was just very disappointed with this and frustrated every time I had to use it. Plus, it was too wide to get in the tight spots on my floors and it wouldn't [[go]] right up to the edges.

She was very brave in letting us scrape the dead skin off the wart (a very important step)--a few times until it bleed.

After 9 treatments the wart is only minimally smaller. We should have just [[went]] to the dr. to begin with! We have had success in the past using Compound W and duct tape but nothing would stick to my daughter's foot at the location of the wart. So, unless your wart in tiny, save your money!

The music was intoxicating, relaxing, and perplexing, and I [[loved]] every second of it. Now, with more recent releases, Porcupine Tree has been taking a more rock oriented aproach with mixed results... until this. This album has everything. It has intricate instrumentals, rhythm changes, hard guitar meat, acoustic passages and still remains to be experimental and psychedelic. Wilson's vocals have always been fantastic, but here they are showcased better than ever on this album. Most of this album (though not all) has a [[dark]] tone, which I think suits them perfectly. "Strip the Soul" is the perfect example. It is very dark and metallic sounding, yet very easy to listen to.

best western ever: Kevin Costner doesn't get credit for being as good of an actor as he really is. It's nice to be able to see Warner Bros. release a film in the Western genre that, for once, doesn't have anything to do with Clint Eastwood. Val Kilmer's portrayal of the same character in "Tombstone" wasn't nearly as good as the one in this edition. I don't own the Digital Video Disc yet, so I'm not sure if I read something correctly which said that the actual three-hour feature is split onto two discs.

[[Surprising]]: I bought and read this novel with no idea of its acclaim. I must say that I never expected to greatly enjoy a story of a boy growing up in Jewish Harlem and certainly did not expect to relate to the main character. Roth prods us to look at ourselves and see our own attempts to break free of our stereotypes. An absolutely great read.

My baby likes the shape and won't take any other shape (WAL MART made a great knock-off around 1999 - 2000, but don't make that model anymore, and the knock-off's did NOT leak, I still have them). Sometimes I can get one lid to fit a particular bottle without leaking, and I try to mark the lid and bottle with matching nail polish so that I can get an exact, no-leak match. But what a hassle! And the markings eventually wear off. I'm on baby 3, so I've got plenty of experience when I say these LEAK. I give it two stars, because the baby likes the shape.

Una pareja ideal: Bose + Torroja: Que buena idea. Desde el anuncio de su gira en conjunto tuve la sensacion de que estaba dormido. Sus voces han dado melodia a muchos de mis momentos mas interesantes, asi que tendria que haber sonado algo tan sublime. Tuve el presentimiento que no iba a ser capaz de verlos juntos, y pense ojala que saquen un album de la gira. Satisfecho quede al verlos en Nueva York, y ahora puedo recordar ese momento magico en escena al escuchar el CD. Aqui tratan de recobrar la magia y lo consiguen con el publico de A Coruna prendido en una noche de verano. Eso si, si pudieras verles quedarias un poco mas prendados de estos artistas que se dan en vivo y en directo de una forma especial.

Conventional mid-70s [[hard]] rock: [[Bad]] Company's self titled debut is still their best studio album. Unfortunately, it never achieves the mastery that lead singer Paul Rodgers's previous band Free did on the brilliant "Fire and Water." This album is a fine collection of good but not spectacular hard rock songs. The title song "Bad Company," the hit single "Can't Get Enough" and "Ready For Love" are probably the best of the batch, with "Seagull" trailing along close behind. Any fan of 70s rock will probably find plenty here to keep them content.

I made it though, but barely. I thought that The Nanny Diaries was OK, and when I read the back of this I thought I would enjoy it, but not so much. I found the character hard to empathize with and in the end I didn't really care what happened to her. Overall, a book I would never recommend to anyone. Glad I bought it at a used book store for super cheap.

Not As Funny As It Could Be But Still Enjoyable: Do you have a friend who complains about their job all the time? (Though in this economy they should just be thankful to have a job...) Do you want them to stop complaining? Well, have I found the fun/gag gift for you. 50 Jobs Worse Than Yours is a short but fun book that could make anybody feel good about what they do for a living. Unless of course, their job is on the list.Ranging from common jobs like data entry to the truly bizarre such as Chick Sexer (if you want to know what that is, buy the book to find out), this book is a great way to boost your friend's ego. Or shut them up. Along with each job there is a picture, dress code, education, job description, pay, skills, benefits, and drawbacks (many of which are obvious). A few jobs listed don't seem to bad though who knew that being "The Before Guy" was a job? Kind of sad really...I found this book at work and spent a good amount of time laughing through it. Great way to lift your spirits.

There are much better titles available: Half of the book is a history of several value investors. But this section is quite superficial in how these individuals screened/found the opportunities they did. Little is told of how they valued the companies and how a wanna-be investor should procede in doing this themselves. The first half of the book is ok, but again could use more help in terms of how to find prospective value companies. Chapter 6 is about the only good chapter. It analyses WD-40 (the company). I recommend instead "The Intelligent Investor" (2003 ed.) by the late Ben Graham and Jason Zweig. It lives up to Buffett's praise of "...by far the best book about investing ever written."

You [[get]] what you pay for: I bought this system after reading the many favorable reviews on Amazon.com. The setup instructions left a little to be desired, but it was fairly easy. Everything seemed fine and then, after about 3 weeks, the Front Right speaker went out. I tested the speaker and the wire which were both fine. With the exception of opening the case, there was no way for me to fix it. So, back in the box (which, of course, I didn't keep) and back to Amazon. Ordinarily, I try to stick with high-end stuff and I bought this for my kids. I learned my lesson with this one.

I've been using it on my cutting board and knives.Lastly you can't make your own spray by mixing with water and chlorine. The mixture that we make at home becomes unstable after a few days and will loose the ability to kill germs. I'm not sure exactly what clorox is using in order to make this spray stable and effective.

scifi [[classic]], redux: I read this [[last]] in the summer of 1985, as required summer reading for school. It's intended mostly as an exploration of the ideas of racial purity, vs. evolution and mutation, using the characters (humans who have the mutant ability of telepathy) as the exploration vehicle. The story is set in Labrador, in Canada, following what looks like a rather destructive nuclear war, with the society that survives having some rather puritanical religious views on genetic purity. Back when I first read the book, I took the story as being rather one-sided, in favour of the mutants, but now I read it as more evenly balanced.

[[Works]] as expected: I ordered a [[hitch]] with the install kit. Item arrived on-time, and at the time I ordered, this was the cheapest price on the internet. I had it delivered to my auto mechanic who installed this in the truck for me. The only complaint is that the bolt holding the head to the frame was missing. A quick call to Reese and it arrived the next day in the mail. Very happy with this product.The slider on the hitch is great when maneuvering the trailer into tight corners. You can easily slide the hitch back away from the cab, allowing for an almost 90 degree turn. With the flip of a bar, the hitch will slide back to the towing position, allowing the weight to sit over your axels when driving down the road.

DOES WHAT A PHONE IS SUPPOSED TO DO: Geez, all this angst about what the razr does and doesn't do. I've owned several phones and this one excels in most of the "real world" applications, such as: 1. I hardly ever get a dropped call, 2. It is thin enough to rest in my front pants pocket without feeling like I've got a hummer in there. 3. The body is tough and seems like it will last a good long time. 4. no antenna sticking out, need I say more? 5. I can see the screen-all the time. 6. menu is [[easy]] to navigate. 7. The camera works great in a pinch. If I wanted to take "real" pictures, I would have a "real" camera with me. So, all in all, it does what it should without any major annoyances.

A Great Opera -- a slightly disappointing Release: Jenufa -- Leos Janacek's "breakout" composition -- had a long and in some ways turgid performance history. The present recording, using the "original" score (before major revisions by the composer in the 1920s) is welcome if only for the ability to compare Janacek's original intention with his later reflections and alterations. Having said that, the audio quality lacks immediacy and presence and the otherwise excellent production values are ultimately hindered by the lackluster sound. Indeed, after viewing this DVD I immediately took out the MacKerras Jenufa recording (Elizabeth Soderstrum) to remind me just exactly how this magnificent opera is supposed to "sound." It's a pity that there is not another DVD available; this opera deserves the widest possible audience.

It recommends you give up everything for the sake of being thin including caffeine, sweeteners, and meat. When looking to lose weight, it is better to ease into life changes than give everything up cold turkey. The habits will not stick otherwise.

Honest narrative of a difficult story: This is a difficult story to tell, mainly because reality is much less dramatic than the myth surrounding this episode, especially after the Spielberg movie. Firstly, most of the initial assassinations in the wake of Munich were low-level logistical support people who probably were not even involved in the original massacre. On balance, aside from Ali Hassan Salameh, the goal of revenge, as the title "Striking Back" suggests, was never really achieved (and even that his involvement disputed by some of Klein's sources). I suppose that is a bitter reality of any anti-terrorist effort. However, the book really loses its way after the "Spring of Youth" operation in Beirut, as the original story line of punishing the perpetrators of Munich fades into the more humdrum and bloody story of tit-for-tat killings after attacks. Once again, this is probably not the author's fault but rather a testament to the honesty with which a difficult story is told.

Dont waste your money!: After much review, my daughter decided to add this pump to her baby registry since she only planned on pumping occasionally.But, during the second use, the pump just stopped working right in the middle of pumping and would not restart. She also noticed that the pump was difficult to use since the suction kept breaking. It was also very loud. Luckily, Baby's R US exchanged this pump and let her upgraded to the Pump N Style and she loves it. Its much easier to use and it has a larger motor which is necessary even for the occasional pumper. It is, of coarse, a bigger investment but if you want a reliable breast pump consider making the investment.

[[Good]] Enough To [[Finish]]: This is the first of Carol Goodman's books I have ever read, and the [[cover]] pages notes this is a debut novel. I wouldn't classify it "gothic" and it probably should be in the "mystery" section however, it was good enough to finish. I have to agree with other reviewers - I definately figured it out pretty early in the book, both the "who" of who dunnit, and the "who" of who she was with May Day. With that said, the book was definately a good read, too much latin, yet I did want to see how it ended. The ending was a little rushed, but satisfying. I will be curious to see how Ms Goodman's other novels compare.

gauge appears inaccurate: It seems that these gauges are not very accurate. When I checked the measurements on factory gapped plugs against this gauge and a more traditional blade-type set of gauges, the blade gauges matched the factory spec much more closely than this gauge did.This style of tapered gap gauge is usually preferred, so maybe another make or model would be more carefully manufactured than this particular one.Caveat emptor.

The last word: I wished there was more early footage of the hep cat himself when he was in his early prime as head of Atlantic. Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet. I just read a new bio of Ahmet and this makes the perfect supplement. You will need to see this if you know the story of Atlantic Records.

The main character is far too omniscient, [[yet]] when he claims that he isn't (which actually [[cook]] the trait even more [[teasing]] than usual). And the main female character is so one-dimensional it [[smart]].The main [[game]] had lots of opportunities to overcome the characterization issues, but [[go]] by a long mark.

Pretika Facial Care System: I was very happy with this product and its performance until the battery stopped holding a charge; which was after the 3rd charge.Now it is useless. Until the company corrects the battery problem I would not waste my money purchasing it. Maybe someone needs to recharge the quality control department so they can do their job.

Diana Ross/ Beyonce Knowles: This could have been a classic and a mile stone for the girls, but once again the song is overpowered with Beyonces vocals. First of all the song, though catchy, is too repetitive and too obivious. First Beyonce sings her verse then Kelly and then Michelle. What would have made the song more interesting and more of a classic, is to have Michelle sing the whole song. Why Not!!! Remember when TLC had Chilli on the lead vocal on 'No Scrubs', it was instantly a classic. Beacause TLC fans were used to hearing T-Boz in the lead this raised the bar for TLC and gave their fans something new. How refreshing would it be to let the othe members of the group have there moment to shine?

Disappointed: I purchased this DVD player as a replacement for my existing DVD player solely for the purpose of converting my DVD movies to 1080i HD on my Sony LCD widescreen TV. An HDMI plug is not furnished with the unit and the additional cost of an HDMI plug is as much or more than the player itself. After connecting the unit and setting it up according to the onscreen menu instructions, I inserted several different commercially purchased movies and was not able to detect any visible difference in the picture quality as compared with my older unit. Trying the component video jacks in place of the HDMI plug resulted in no improvement in picture quality. I have emailed the Panasonic website, technical support department for assistance but after 3 days have still had no reply. If you're looking to enhance your DVD's to high definition, this is probably not the unit to buy.

a...coffee coaster: Anarchy online is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game set on a fictional planet in the distant future. It has an evolving storyline that uses the classic rebels verses the establishment theme. There is no magic in the game. The traditional magic element is replaced by almost equally mystical use of nano-technology. Players can assume the roles of spies, soldiers, doctors, nano-technologists and other various futuristic professions.The graphics are lovely and it has fabulous sound effects. There are no zones (ala Everquest) except for entering apartments, cities and quests. THe interface is... usable...The only problem is that the entire experience left me cold. This game is so lovely that it was almost sterile. Where is its heart and soul?If you love the future and need a switch from the previous MMORPG's on the market try this game. I, in the meantime, will sadly set my coffee cup down on my new...coffee coaster and wait for the next big thing.Singerspell

When I was first reading Lovecraft, I became hooked, and simply LOOKING at this book was a surprise - really quite cool. A must-have accessory for any player as well as keeper - even players can marvel at the creature statistics, and hope they don't meet whatever is in the book on their CoC adventures...Cthulhu's stats made me jump...Anyway, a visually pleasing (depending on your asthetic values) book, as well as a necessity to playing the greatest RPG ever created...enjoy!

OK, but not meant as a leash.: This is a great leash for a smaller lizard, I had originally bought this for my bearded dragon, which was great untill he grew a little bigger. This no longer fits him but it fits my young argus monitor pretty well, but i will never trust this on him. I think the harness was orginally meant for having you lizard on your SHOULDER just beacasue how short the string is and how the string is so fat and heavy, but for a good reason. Lizards should not be %100 trusted in these, My bearded Dragon was able to escape from this like 4 times out of about 50. He never left, he just wanted out of the thing, and yes, it was secured to him properly. The fat string on this item is probably the thing i hate most, It is all fine and good untill it starts to fray with regular use. This catches on the lizards claws and makes it very difficult for the lizard and the owner.

[[Terrible]] book: I was forced to buy this book as part of a Minorities in Society [[course]]. This book is [[terrible]]. The author obviously has an agenda and it bleeds over throughout the text. Although purported to be about various minority groups, it focuses on black males for the most part. Even the chapter on Gender (feminist issues), Sexual Preference, and Disability has a huge section on black males. The author continually [[blames]] the government and white males for every problem facing minorities. If you're a white male and want to [[understand]] why every social problem is your fault, this is the book for you. Otherwise, find something else.

Every opinion counts for something: I regret giving this author one star here, because I'm sure this kind of writing appeals to some people. Just not to me. He's obviously a great writer, very descriptive writer, but my problem was I didn't care about anything in here. He didn't create a world or a vision that drew me in. For me he just created chaos, a lack of storyline and an ending that left me angry over wasting my time. I believe storyline and characters are the crucial two ingredients, without which a novel might someday be called great literature, but will never make a great movie. In this case, he created a world where a plague has hit. This world of the newly dead are all peopling this book as long as there are still people living who can remember them. But this peopling of the dead reads as though these dead people exist exactly the same as if they were still living. You might enjoy his representation of this, but I did not.

Meh: [[I]] was a [[big]] [[fan]] of the [[show]], and I [[enjoyed]] the first movie.I was not a big fan of this movie though. I did not like the way it portrayed Big and Carrie's marriage. Carrie is upset that they don't go out to fancy restaurants all the time. When Big comes home with takeout she gets upset. I just can't believe how much money is being tossed around without a second thought. Eating out, getting takeout every day, that's so expensive, especially in NYC. And I hated Carrie's reaction to Big wanting to relax at home. Not every day has to be spent out partying and getting drunk. What's wrong with cuddling on the couch? It doesn't mean you're in a rut, or that you're boring as she implies. And Big asking to spend 2 days apart every week? for me that would be the [[end]] of the marriage

Don't buy this, you will be very very disappointed. I wanted to just throw the DVD away. It looks bootleg. The cartoon titles are often cut off at the top and bottom of the screen.

Dolby's best effort, bar none: This album is what Dolby fans live for, pure energy! Thomas Dolby moves this album through a series of changes that takes each song and pushes the energy level up a notch, in succession, the album builds and builds, bringing a climax that starts at the beginning and holds you there with a majority of the album. KEYS TO FERRARI is fun as he pulls you into the driver's seat and tells you what he REALLY thinks. HOT SAUCE is fun, bringing the level up yet again, its zesty and has a funk to it that will move even those who dare not dance in public. Dolby does himself justice with this album, as it looks as though he took all that musicality that flows through his body and put it into something that is difficult to replicate. For anyone who has or has not heard Dolby, THIS IS THE ALBUM TO BUY. If it hooks you, then get the others, but this is where to start.

[[cabin]] Boy. It was the dumbest movie I've ever seen. [[halt]] [[patch]], if there was any, about some spoiled rich kid ("Fancy Lad") named Nathaniel who's a total idiot trying to go back home with his "adventures" on the way. I, a person with no knowledge whatsoever in movie [[pee-pee]], could just guess right away that the "sea" was pure swimming pool and that the "ship" was going nowhere. All the props were "visible" and [[speculative]] of all, it was plain STUPID. Such a sad, horrible movie. An insult to the viewers.

An inspiring [[story]], even for non football lovers: I admit it, I was a skeptic. I was not, and still am not, much of a football fan. When Rudy came out in theaters, I had no interest. It was only happening across a review of the film that I decided to get the DVD. What a suprise! Rudy is one of those movies that inspired me. A truly wonderful, moving story, beautifully told. Even more [[amazing]] is the fact that it is based on a true story!As for the DVD itself, I was very pleased with the sound and video quality. Anamorphic video is sharp and saturated, and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is stirring and makes good use of the surround speakers. The extras on the disc are good (a commentary track would have been a nice addition), but the featurettes, featuring interviews with the real Rudy are teriffic.Highly reccomended

Required Reading: As I read this book, I kept thinking about Paul Simon's line "When I think back / On all the crap I read in high school" (OK, he said "learned," not "read," not much difference).Why isn't this book required reading? Is there a better book to demonstrate that literature written by dead white males can be completely captivating, extraordinarily wise about the ways of the world, wonderfully revealing of of human nature, instructive of history in a way a standard text rarely is, exquisitely written, and fully capable of instilling a love of literature to last a lifetime?I suppose the book is too French (the American educational system will admit a Fijian sooner than it will a Frenchman). And, yes, it has lots of sex. But making young minds fondle Catcher in the Rye when Bel Ami is about is simply criminal. Enjoy.

Really disappointing: For something this fanciful to work, every element, from the characters to the plot to the setting, has to contribute to the suspension of disbelief. None of this took place. The characters were cardboard, the plot meandered, the background was hazy. I will still try to slog through it just because I always try to finish books, but this one's going to take me a while. Sorry, didn't work for me.A note on how I read, and how I review:When they begin to bore me, or I stop believing in the world the writer is attempting to create, I stop reading and move on to something else. There are so many books, and so little time, that it's simply not worth spending time on books that aren't getting the job done. If the book isn't holding your interest, why bother?

Creative and [[exciting]] [[short]] fiction...: When I first came across this book in it's initial paperback printing, I was excited by his blend of outrageous humor and insightful prose. Especially hilarious is the story about two friends, one of whom plays with things for a living. He looks for the "intrinsic ludic value" of ordinary household items, or rather, would they make good toys. He had one relationship end because of the natural similarities between the shape of a flying saucer and the shape of a birth control pill dispenser. On a whole, it reminded me of Raymond Carver but without the suicidal tendencies. More mature (but not as funny) as his wonderful first novel _The Mysteries of Pittsburgh_, I am looking forward to his next volume of short fiction as it seems to me that the short story is his true gift.

I have always liked that they seem softer and more clothe-like than Huggies. They also seem to fit him better too - he is on the slim side. [[Perhaps]] they are more expensive than other brands, but personally, I have found it worthwhile to spend a bit more to get a comfortable diaper that fits well. Plus, I [[love]] ordering them from Amazon and having them delivered to my door. Much [[better]] than having to lug them home from the store!

Could be more concise: Although I second the other revierw here, I must add that this book could be some 100 pages shorter and still hit the mark. The way it is, Lambrecht uses too much words to deliver his message.Also, because of the subject matter itself, the book is a bit outdated.Other than that, good reading material.

Nostalgia [[Only]]: Having grown up in the Wood (which we never called it) it reminded me of first loves and innocence. I found myself more interested in the whereabouts of my once close friends rather than being truly involved in the story being told. Been there. Done that. Got the T-shirt and the hat. Not to diss what paid someone's bills, but The Wood was just a film. My memories are priceless, but the total running time of the flick is time i'll get never back. I'm not quite sure it was worth that.

[[Horrible]] Hair Dryer: [[I]] purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush. I have never been so [[disappointed]] in a "salon quality" hair dryer. I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry. I am very good at getting a salon [[quality]] blow-out at home. I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now. If I wasn't so busy, I would send it [[back]] and demand a full refund. I [[feel]] like I was [[duped]]. The strength of the [[dryer]] is poor, which results in dry fly-aways. It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it [[looks]] like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer. I have [[used]] the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them. Don't fall for the hype - this [[company]] may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.

Entirely useless: Having heard so much about this great, breakthrough book, I was really disappointed. The approach to riding was certainly unusual, but I found none of the images helpful in any way, and in fact if you follow her images closely, you will end up riding incorrectly, as is apparent by the incorrect position seen in many of the pictures throughout the book. She falls into the common trap of thinking riding is about relaxing and balancing, rather than a highly athletic endeavor that requires strong isotonic contractions of many muscles, primarily the abs and thigh muscles.

Easy Rider is the [[best]] movie that was [[made]] before I was born: This movie is about two guys who get a lot of money from a drug deal and decide to take a tour of America on two Harley Davidson motorcycles circa 1969. They get into a lot of adventures that include meeting a hick Jack Nickolson. This movie was wierd and that is why I liked it so much. It wasn't wierd in a dumb way. It made you think. Not a lot of movies do that to me, but this one did. The movie had a message when it was released for it's time. Now it's just a great movie. This movie has lots of grass smoking and an acid trip and they did it all in a cool way. Not blatantly like some movies do with drugs. If you have an open mind and don't mind seeing how the other side think and live then you will like this film. I've seen it three times. One last thing. Great music. From Jimmy Hendrix to The Byrds they have a lot of killer rock tunes.

Amerivoice is false advertising, theft of service: Amerivoice has falsely advertised "unlimited service" and is ripping off consumers. I had this for 1-1/2 years but now they are strictly enforcing time limits. Did work good and quality was excellent but now its only a block of 1200 minutes per month for $29.95, not unlimited. They are monitoring all your calls on spreadsheets, as soon as you go over the allottment they will e-mail you a 5-day cancellation notice unless you renew and confirm service at 3.9 cents per minute. Obviously Amerivoice can no longer fulfill the unlimited long distance service that was advertised in media and on packaging at Office Depot, Costco. Amerivoice should be at top of the list for FTC enforcement action as well as a class action lawsuit. Sprint and SBC now both offer true unlimited long distance for an additional $20 per month as part of local phone packages, a much better and cheaper choice

Retractable cord [[broke]] after 2 months!: The hairdryer works just fine. I've used a Conair product for years before it finally died and this is the replacement model I purchased mid December of 2007. Just as other users have noted, be very careful of the retractable cord as it does go WAY too fast and has a tendency to sock you in the face or hand as it flies in. But [[worse]] yet, the retractable cord broke after only 2 months of use. Now it is permanently retracted and I can't seem to unjam it. That [[means]] I can't [[pull]] the power cord out and therefore can't use the dryer. What a piece of junk! Of course the 2 year [[warranty]] asks you to mail this heavy sucker back and then pay $5 to cover shipping back to you. Meanwhile, the hairdryer is only $20... you do the math. Another fault is that the lettering on the dryer (high, low, hot, cool, etc) rubs off within days. Not a big deal, but another cheap factor. I'd still buy Conair, just not the retractable cord version.
