It really helps my mom: I buy these for my Mom. She's 88 and still doing most everything she needs to do. She feels weak when she runs out of them, so I'm frequently ordering these for her. For some reason, she feels the Maxi-sorb works better for her, and won't take any other kind.

Complete Disappointment: Bought the item ...No instructions ... Used my imagination and what I have read on several forums ... Placed the Receiver dirctly in front of the Satellite receiver box, about three inches away from the box infra-red eye ...Placed the sender in a room on the ground floor, about 50 feet away with walls and stairway in between .. Pointed the remote and nothing happened ...Took the sender to the room where the Receiver unit was, placed it about four feet away from the Receiver unit and tried changing channels in the same room ...after many, many and I mean many tries (about one hour time), I was able to change one channel ...then nothing more .. I tried attaching the enclosed eye to the infra-red eye of the box ..but that did not improve anything!My opinion and rating: It is a complete waste of money and time to buy this product. There is no way I would recommend anyone to buy it.

Perfectly serviceable: Quite decent paper towels -- not much to say about it. Their absorbency is a little bit less than nonrecycled ones, but not bad, and no further trees had to be cut down for it.What the product description should say but doesn't: these are 120-sheet rolls. Each sheet is 11x9".Something I didn't entirely realize before I ordered a box -- thirty rolls is a lot of paper towels. Like, oh, twenty pounds of the stuff. So you're going to have these on hand for a while. You'll have to bring them along when you move, and they'll watch the children whose playpens you cleaned up with the first of them leave for college after wiping their car's dipstick with the last. It's something of a committment, really.

Essential compilation: One of the best compilations to come out in the last few years. track number 25 "falling in love again" by Johnny Moore ended up being played over and over again on my stereo. Great duet singing hauntingly beautiful in the same way as listening to the Everly Brothers harmonize. It's great to have alot of these hard (or even impossible) to find singles on CD. Many of these tracks are not overly reliant on hooks, so they definitely need continued listening to realize just how incredible most of these songs are. But well worth the effort.

Rincewind's a bit of a bore and hasn't Australia suffered enough?: It's funny how the character that started the series remains my least favorite recurring figure in Pratchett's Discworld books. Rincewind is a one note character whose perpetual cowardice wears a bit more each time he appears. While "Running away, keeps him alive," it also is unbearably predictable. Another difficulty with this one is that the too obvious Australia references read like a Monty Python skit that has gone on for far too long. This one's a throwaway in the series, for every good laugh there's about 50 pages of plodding along. There is an interesting Pratchett take on evolution and creation that brighten things up temporarily, but this pleasure is buried amidst what is easily one of my least favorite books in the series. It's rare that Pratchett writes one with little to recommend it, but The Last Continent fits that description all too well.

It is a book you return to again and again!: In learning the characteristics of watercolor, this is a book I return to again and again. The author has classified each basic color as to its' transparency, its' complement, and executes a painting with that palette, and much more!

Worthless Junk: These headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. The inline volume control never did work properly; it always got one side higher than the other. The supposed Noise-Canceling feature is a joke; it only cuts out constant sustained sounds of the same pitch, which means that the only thing they ever blocked out was the whistle on my tea kettle, which is the one thing I would prefer to not have blocked out. After about 4 months of only occasionally usage, one of the speakers stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money.

Pretty good triller with a different twist that you have to watch all the way threw to understand: This movie is much different then normal suspense trillers or mystery thrillers that most of us are use to. Leo does a great acting job and the supporting actors add to the drama and intensity of the film. I have personally watched it 3 times now since I've have bought it a while ago. It took me watching it 3 times to fully understand the whole movie and what the main character meant at the end of the movie. So if you like Martin Scorsese movies then pick this movie up and watch it all the way threw to fully understand the movie and whole plotline of the movie your watching. It is really a good suspense triller and lots of drama. Buy it and make up your own mind about the actors and the plotline because it is a good movie.

Pointless Item: [[As]] a consumer with limited disposable income and even less time to clean up the messes that my son so enjoys making, I had high hopes for this product. I finished setting it up, put my son in the high chair and thought it might just work. With one swift kick from my son, any of the food that was in this catcher fell onto the floor. I fixed it and he would kick again.This product was pointless in my view. I [[wish]] I had known that there was [[going]] to be absolutely no [[room]] for my little one to kick.

NnyCW for Capcom City: Mega Man Anniversary Collection takes the original 8 Mega Man games, throws in two arcade Mega Man games (one unrealesed in the USA until now) and combine them all to form one hell of a great Mega Man package. Then Capeven added Navi mode to all eight games (something that was added later in the series, and can be turned off if you want to play them as they originally were) added re-mixed music, and added in a save feature to replace the pass codes from the old games. The XBOX version included the extras from both the PS2 and the GCN version (PS2 version included a full episode of the Mega Man cartoon and the GCN version icluded an interview with the creator of Mega Man) Because of the fact that the XBOX version includes the extras from both the others, makes this the best one to get.

Works ONLY with Windows XP: I purchased this item intending to use it on my Dell laptop, which came with Vista 64. The software does NOT install - says that only Windows XP is supported, and to install the software on another machine with XP (yeah, right, I just have one right here ready to go). I contacted Neatco about this and they told me to purchase a later version of their software, but the catch is that that means you have to get a whole new scanner and all for $199. NO THANKS!!! I've been a lifelong computer enthusiast and this is really the only company I've encountered that forces you to purchase an all new product for a driver update. (Everyone else provides driver updates that are either free, or do not detect the native OS and disable the software.) They have obviously built-in the obsolesence.I tried installing in XP compatibility mode, but the software gives me the same error - obviously, Neatco is deliberately seeking out the software revision before allowing installation to proceed.

My dog doesn't care for them: My dog, a German Shepherd, didn't think much of these. Her favorite treat, chicken jerky dog treats from a store that starts with "C" and ends with "ostco", she scarfs up very quickly and with real excitement & enjoyment. These Blue Dog treats she sniffs and won't take.They do LOOK tasty to me though, to the point where I want to take a bite. Maybe I would like them more than my dog does.
