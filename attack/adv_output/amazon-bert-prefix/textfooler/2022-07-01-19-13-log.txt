Essential compilation: One of the best compilations to come out in the last few years. track number 25 "falling in love again" by Johnny Moore ended up being played over and over again on my stereo. Great duet singing hauntingly beautiful in the same way as listening to the Everly Brothers harmonize. It's great to have alot of these hard (or even impossible) to find singles on CD. Many of these tracks are not overly reliant on hooks, so they definitely need continued listening to realize just how incredible most of these songs are. But well worth the effort.

Rincewind's a bit of a [[bore]] and hasn't Australia suffered enough?: It's funny how the character that started the series remains my least favorite recurring figure in Pratchett's Discworld books.

Worthless Junk: These headphones are very uncomfortable to wear. The inline volume control never did work properly; it always got one side higher than the other. The supposed Noise-Canceling feature is a joke; it only cuts out constant sustained sounds of the same pitch, which means that the only thing they ever blocked out was the whistle on my tea kettle, which is the one thing I would prefer to not have blocked out. After about 4 months of only occasionally usage, one of the speakers stopped working altogether. Don't waste your money.

He had wanted this game for several months but I was'nt sure he'd like it as much as he wanted it but it was one of those games that I was wrong about- He loves it! I have to admit it is really a fun game. The bowling pens shake and talk to you as you play and they say funny, cute phrases. My little boy who is almost 4 can set the game up him self and play it without anyone else or if he wants we can play with him. I like games that he can understand and be able to play without having a second player all the time. It makes this game even more a good purchase because being an only child there is'nt many games that are like this. He loves this game and still plays it a lot even 3 1/2 months later.

Because I enjoy his music so much, I braved the hefty price believing I must have it.[[It]] was a [[woeful]] disappointment for me, however. The disc consists of elongated versions of just a handful of Sting tunes set to drum-machine-produced club beats. I'm not into the club scene and actually enjoy Sting for the variety of world beats he incorporates into his music, so this really rubbed a nerve with me. I really didn't need the 3 disco versions of "Desert Rose" that this CD features.This CD is gonna collect [[dust]].

No, not really: The title of this CD is [[misleading]] in an amazing number of ways. None of the songs are in any way related to rock music, nor, with one exception, are any of the artists. Even calling it a compilation of 60's folk music is a stretch. There are a handful of selections by artists from the early 60's folk scene, but planted among them are songs by a couple of "folk-lite" bands (in the Kingston Trio/PP&M vein), two pop groups, and for some reason, a song by Traffic. I would be fascinated to learn what, in someone's mind, tied these together. Unless you are looking for a specific song, you can [[skip]] this one. Amazon sells dozens of other fine collections which better define both "60's folk" and "the roots of rock".

Professional-type ironing board, but...: In my opinion, this ironing board is worth the money because it is incredibly stable, solid, and has a large ironing surface. Unfortunately, these traits also make it heavy, unwieldy, and difficult to move and set up. I am a relatively petite woman with arthritic hands, so those things are problems for me. The board is so wide that it is difficult to hold both releases at the same time (to let the legs down)and maintain control of the process. The board generally ends up sort of falling into place, which is not great. The board is also quite a bit heavier to carry and manuver than other boards I've used. On the extras, the rack for the iron and for hanging clothes is very handy (and fits the big iron perfectly), and the stacking rack underneath the board is handy, if you can remember to use it. All in all, I would buy this board again, but it's not perfect, like everything else.

Solid mature album with many musical influences: 3Canal has fulfilled the promise that was shown in Book of Blue in 1997. Musically, 3 Canal used live instrumentation to bring an edge and authenticity to the sound of the album, and took on the challenge of expressing the versatility of the rapso flow over a diverse range of rhythms from calypso and the pulsating jab jab rhythm to Latin, funk, groove, ambient, drum & bass and dance influences.And these guys can really SING!I particularly like "Peace Chant" and "I Believe".This cd is definitely worth buying.

A Drastic [[Disappointment]]: I'm sorry to say this is not one of King's better novels, even though I stuck with it to the end. Here are the pros and cons of the novel. King's story is surprisingly original. I must say this is a new direction for him. The novel contains some interesting plot twists. I liked the "crossword puzzle" theme especially. Rogette Whitmore is a strong, frightening character, the kind you love to hate. And the final paragraphs prove to be an interesting conclusion to the story that surprisingly impressed me. BUT...that's not to say the novel has many drawbacks. The third-person narrative stinks--one minute Mike is a serious literary personality, quoting Maugam and Hardy, but the next he babbles on childishly about erections and breasts. Kyra and Mattie are [[annoyingly]] perfect. And, needless to say, the plot seems to drag on forever. BAG OF BONES is sadly a [[disappointment]].

[[Great]] book for the most part: I am in a situation very simiar to that of the author - in a long-term live-in relationship and we've just decided to get married. This book addresses SO MANY of the things that've been bugging me. For example: many marriages end in divorce, how can we be sure this one will last? In all actuallity, no one really knows, because I'm sure just about everyone who gets married truly believes it will be forever. In reality, people change, and it isn't always possible to be together forever. It helps so much just to know other's have struggled with the same issues.The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the book goes off on some weird tangents that didn't flow too well.

This book addresses SO MANY of the things that've been bugging me. For example: many marriages end in divorce, how can we be sure this one will last? In all actuallity, no one really knows, because I'm sure just about everyone who gets married truly believes it will be forever. In reality, people change, and it isn't always possible to be together forever. It helps so much just to know other's have struggled with the same issues.The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because the book goes off on some weird tangents that didn't flow too well. The transitions weren't smooth and I was confused as to why they were included.Overall, [[severely]] good book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is in a similar situation themselves.

And [[NOT]] extras wearing wigs, posing as hippies, as in many Psych-exploitation films of the period like 'Psych-Out, 'The Trip', 'Wild In The Streets, 'Gas-s-s-s' and others. 'Skidoo' has true 'longhairs' - a genuine snapshot of a certain time & place, never to be repeated ever again. So no matter how "bad" or "good" this movie is, it does have this one distinction that I've never seen mentioned in any of the (extremely contrasting) reviews.P.S. Another overlooked item - in the SINGING! credits at the end of the film, STONE COUNTRY is credited as "Themselves". They recorded one very good, self-titled album in Hollywood in 1968 on the RCA label and were (of course) the token group for the movie. Guess which label released the soundtrack of 'Skidoo'? Yes, RCA.

One of most enlightening performances on screen ever made...: After spending more than half of his life in solitary, when a convict (sentenced for having killed 2 people) says: "Life is one of the most precious gift and its the duty of life to live", one wonders if redemption was over or not for him. Though, he never came out of the prison, but redemption in the sense of understanding the meaning of life certainly unfolded to this ornithologist, who became a self-taught authority on curing bird's diseases while serving life-sentence. This movie is an amazing depiction of a true story, about dedication, perseverance and relentless pursuit of "free thinking" from a prisoner-turned-author.

Hate it: I can't stand Shane West as Michael, he was completely miscast for this show. He just seem for me like a really bad actor. I won't pay a penny to see him acting at all. I don't know why they didn't bring back the creator of the LFN the same one that did 24 hours. Maggie looks so fragile that she can break just trying to hit somebody. I like fantasy, but she is way to much, I can't believe her performance at all. And no, real La Femme Nikita fans don't like this show, we hate it.

Not as good as his other Prey books: This Lucas Davenport book is not nearly as exciting or gripping as most of his other books in the Prey series. The plot is too scattered, and Davenport's women problems seemed superficial and forced. It almost seemed to me like the relationship stuff was added as an overlayer in the hopes of reinforcing a loose and weak plot. The ending was very contrived and thus very disappointing.

[[Excellent]] for little infants!: This activity mat was expensive (I bought it full price at almost $60) but there is a lot of usage in it. I started using it with my baby when she was 2 months old, she enjoyed seeing the colorful toys above her. As she grew, she loved being on her tummy with the colorful mat, especially the crinkling leaf. The attached toys were excellent themselves and I used them to clip onto her carseat and crib. Only when she could finally get up and crawl did she tire of the mat.My only [[criticism]] is of the "musical" toy that dangles. It does have a switch on/off which is great. However, the volume of the music is LOUD! Many a dark night I tried to tiptoe past it and had a heart attack when I accidentally tapped the toy & the music blasted. ALso, the sun-mirror comes off easily and is hard to prop up.Again, this is well worth it and a well designed toy for any infant.

After 9 treatments the wart is only minimally smaller. We [[should]] have just went to the dr. to begin with!

[[LEAKY]] - [[terribly]], leaky - even the [[new]] [[ones]]: Some of my Avent bottles leak, and some don't. My baby likes the shape and won't take any other shape (WAL MART made a great knock-off around 1999 - 2000, but don't make that model anymore, and the knock-off's did NOT leak, I still have them). Sometimes I can get one lid to fit a particular bottle without leaking, and I try to mark the lid and bottle with matching nail polish so that I can get an exact, no-leak match. But what a hassle! And the markings eventually wear off. I'm on baby 3, so I've got plenty of experience when I say these LEAK. I give it two stars, because the baby likes the shape.

Una pareja ideal: Bose + Torroja: Que buena idea. Desde el anuncio de su gira en conjunto tuve la sensacion de que estaba dormido. Sus voces han dado melodia a muchos de mis momentos mas interesantes, asi que tendria que haber sonado algo tan sublime. Tuve el presentimiento que no iba a ser capaz de verlos juntos, y pense ojala que saquen un album de la gira. Satisfecho quede al verlos en Nueva York, y ahora puedo recordar ese momento magico en escena al escuchar el CD. Aqui tratan de recobrar la magia y lo consiguen con el publico de A Coruna prendido en una noche de verano. Eso si, si pudieras verles quedarias un poco mas prendados de estos artistas que se dan en vivo y en directo de una forma especial. Y no le doy cinco estrellas, porque creo que eso solo se lo merece el verles en vivo...

Or shut them up. Along with each job there is a picture, dress code, education, job description, pay, skills, benefits, and drawbacks (many of which are obvious). A few jobs listed don't seem to bad though who knew that being "The Before Guy" was a job? Kind of sad really...I found this book at work and spent a good amount of time laughing through it. Great way to lift your spirits.

An excellent addition to any beginners collection: North Light, the publishers of the Watercolor Basics series has hit paydirt once again with Phil Metzgers' Perspective Secrets. In direct simple and engaging language Metzger takes you through the many types of perspective without terrifying you with wordy rules and procedures. It is all covered in this handy and educational volume. You move through beautiful examples of putting space and the illusion of air in your paintings to the subtle issues of close-up perspective such as with bricks. There is also some information on perspective dealing with stairs and inclines all supported by Mr. Metzger's handsome paintings. As with other volumes in this series the subject matter is gone into both more deeply and with more approachable and beautiful artwork. This is a must have for any budding painter.

This one could give mediocrity a bad name: [[Volume]] 7 of the "Have a Nice Day" series is one of the [[worst]] in the [[set]]. There is some [[good]] music here, particularly Melanie's "Brand New Key", Climax's "Precious and Few" (very hard to find!) and Jonathan Edwards' "[[Sunshine]]." However, there are far too many weak sisters (5) for a twelve track CD.It's still a bargain, considering how hard it is to find a few of the songs included, but you'll be buying it for just that, a few select tracks, not the entire disc. Rhino did a great job of mastering, as usual. They should have done as good a job of picking the songs included.

Defective: I have had good luck with off-brand camera batteries in the past so I was confident when I purchased this one as a second battery for my Canon G9. Unfortunately, I have just returned it. When placed in the charger, the charge light would illuminate but, instead of turning green when the charge is complete, the light would just go out. When I tried the battery in the camera - nothing. Would not power up at all. The camera and charger work fine with my original battery, so it's definitely this off-brand battery that's the problem. I won't order another Digital Concepts battery.

Only one copy should have been published, for Peart.: I gotta say, I'm a big fan of Rush music and lyrics, but about a third of the way into this book...... it was like hearing a big balloon deflate. PLththththththth! With all the time and lack of responsibility Peart has that your average forty-something year old North American male will never know, it became very hard for me to keep latched to this book. Riding around, scoffing at the very people who made that journey possible. Doesn't sound like healing to me........And then came the letters..... One objective reviewer put it best. Filler. Just takin' up space in th' book. I felt as though I was reading a Dennis Miller dialogue with inside jokes and references that I, or nobody else know about.I guess I picked up this book because I assumed Pearts song writing ability would transfer into a good long read with the power and emotion I've felt from his songs. But it left me wondering who this book was written for and why? Disappointing.

set yourself onto this album.: 'Set Yourself on Fire' is a great new release from Stars. With poignant lyrics, and a myriad of melodies interlacing on each track, this album is a delight for the ears. Some of the most heart-felt songwriting I've heard in a long time dominates each song; an important feature in great music that has gone so far overlooked in recent years. Of note, the opener, 'Your Ex-Lover is Dead' begins this album on such a breathtaking note, that it is hard not to keep listening. Stars bring to 'Set Yourself on Fire' a unique sound that showcases the talent of this group, while paying homage to the je ne sais quoi that is Montreal. Together with the Arcade Fire, Stars are producing some of the best Canadian music at the moment. This is a great album, and should not be missed. A best pick for this year, for sure. But this album!

scifi [[classic]], redux: I [[read]] this last in the summer of 1985, as required summer reading for school. It's intended mostly as an exploration of the ideas of racial purity, vs. evolution and mutation, using the characters (humans who have the mutant ability of telepathy) as the exploration vehicle. The story is set in Labrador, in Canada, following what looks like a rather destructive nuclear war, with the society that survives having some rather puritanical religious views on genetic purity. Back when I first read the book, I took the story as being rather one-sided, in favour of the mutants, but now I [[read]] it as more evenly [[balanced]]. John Windham was one of my [[favorite]] authors, back in the early 1980s, and I am a big fan of The Day of the Triffids, which I re-read back in 2004.

A Great Opera -- a slightly disappointing Release: Jenufa -- Leos Janacek's "breakout" composition -- had a long and in some ways turgid performance history. The present recording, using the "original" score (before major revisions by the composer in the 1920s) is welcome if only for the ability to compare Janacek's original intention with his later reflections and alterations. Having said that, the audio quality lacks immediacy and presence and the otherwise excellent production values are ultimately hindered by the lackluster sound. Indeed, after viewing this DVD I immediately took out the MacKerras Jenufa recording (Elizabeth Soderstrum) to remind me just exactly how this magnificent opera is supposed to "sound." It's a pity that there is not another DVD available; this opera deserves the widest possible audience.

not impressed: This book was crude at best. The language was inappropriate, and the advice was given in a way that was demeaning to the reader. If you are looking for a book to inspire you and help you on your journey toward health, I would not look here. It has an all or nothing approach to. It recommends you give up everything for the sake of being thin including caffeine, sweeteners, and meat. When looking to lose weight, it is better to ease into life changes than give everything up cold turkey. The habits will not stick otherwise. Read this book with caution and take with a grain of salt.

The Jain Awstin Book Club: I'm wondering if the author meant to write about the lesser-known author Jain Awstin, who creates 2-dimensional characters and plots that begin and end somewhere in the middle of the action. This book is a crushing disappointment because I don't think ANYONE buys a book called The Jane Austen Book Club without hoping for something tying it to Jane Austen. The characters are boring, poorly-developed, and annoyingly chick-lit (wow, a tough, lesbian character who speaks her mind and dresses a bit over-the-top? How unique.). I think the only thing I enjoyed about this book were the very few quotes from JA's books. Not that this book is about Jane Austen. Because it's not.

Honest narrative of a difficult story: This is a difficult story to tell, mainly because reality is much less dramatic than the myth surrounding this episode, especially after the Spielberg movie. Firstly, most of the initial assassinations in the wake of Munich were low-level logistical support people who probably were not even involved in the original massacre. On balance, aside from Ali Hassan Salameh, the goal of revenge, as the title "Striking Back" suggests, was never really achieved (and even that his involvement disputed by some of Klein's sources). I suppose that is a bitter reality of any anti-terrorist effort. However, the book really loses its way after the "Spring of Youth" operation in Beirut, as the original story line of punishing the perpetrators of Munich fades into the more humdrum and bloody story of tit-for-tat killings after attacks. Once again, this is probably not the author's fault but rather a testament to the honesty with which a difficult story is told.

I love just about anything from Corelle but their new lines of minimalist designs leave me cold. I'm so glad I was able to find the ones I have.

I absolutely love this water bottle: It keeps my water cold for hours and hours. I own two of these and just bought this one on Amazon as a gift. The pop-up top actually works pretty well (and is pretty fun) and is great for one-handed drinking. The insulation works well. The seal has worked well for me. I think everyone should have one of these.

this film [[lacks]] the oxygen to make it a really good thriller: This film has an intense premise and the thriller aspects of it should have a high pace, but the psychological torments just don't [[add]] up. Adrien Brody is superb and creepy as the Houdini killer. At times the film feels made-for-TV rather than a true portrayal of the horror of this drama. Henry (played by Brody) asks the female detective (played by Maura Tierney) is she knows what's it's like being clever. That seems to be the problem with this film - it tries to be clever rather than to follow the logistical progression of its own storyline.

I replaced the battery maybe three times. I wore this watch daily and beat the heck out of it, replacing only the battery and the band. I finally even put a stainless steel band on it to make it look a little more "civilized." True, during its last 6 months or so, it started to stop for a few minutes once in a while.

A [[Big]] [[Disappointment]]!: I've used and enjoyed many of Leslie's tapes. I particularly like the one-mile tapes as I've found them to be a great way to work in some exercise -- either early or later in the day. The main problem with this tape, which Leslie does unaccompanied by other pros or amateurs, (no weights are used either) is that:1) The "music" is really unpleasant; it is just fast noise. It really doesn't have a beat to which you can move naturally.2) There is no [[adequate]] warm-up or cool-down.3) The DVD is in a small fitted case, no bigger than the dvd, which makes it hard to store with other DVDs.If you're looking for a good quick workout, I'd recommend the following two from her Walk Away the Pounds series: 1) Power Mile; 2) Get Up and Get Started (I have this on DVD with the two-mile High Calorie Burn).

The last word: I wished there was more early footage of the hep cat himself when he was in his early prime as head of Atlantic. Mostly, this relies on late life footage that is still extremely interesting, such as when Ahmet and Ray Charles sit at the piano and reminisce, or with Robert Plant and Mick Jagger. Only late Jerry Wexler is seen here, also, which is too bad because he would have been interesting as a young man, driving the record company to new heights along with Ahmet. I just read a new bio of Ahmet and this makes the perfect supplement. You will need to see this if you know the story of Atlantic Records.

It Tries...: The book's summary made me think the book had a lot of potential. Sadly, the story lacks any real, multi-dimensional characters. The main character is far too omniscient, even when he claims that he isn't (which actually makes the trait even more annoying than usual). And the main female character is so one-dimensional it hurts.The main plot had lots of opportunities to overcome the characterization issues, but fails by a long mark. The ending is, in my opinion, too 'Hollywood.' I had high hopes for this story, but it failed, in my opinion. Overall, I would not recommend this story.

First of all the song, though catchy, is too repetitive and too obivious. First Beyonce sings her verse then Kelly and then Michelle. What would have made the song more interesting and more of a classic, is to have Michelle sing the whole song. Why Not!!! Remember when TLC had Chilli on the lead vocal on 'No Scrubs', it was instantly a classic. Beacause TLC fans were used to hearing T-Boz in the lead this raised the bar for TLC and gave their fans something new.

It has an evolving storyline that uses the classic rebels verses the establishment theme. There is no magic in the game. The traditional magic element is replaced by almost equally mystical use of nano-technology. Players can assume the roles of spies, soldiers, doctors, nano-technologists and other various futuristic professions.The graphics are lovely and it has fabulous sound effects. There are no zones (ala Everquest) except for entering apartments, cities and quests. THe interface is... usable...The only problem is that the entire experience left me cold. This game is so lovely that it was almost sterile. Where is its heart and soul?If you love the future and need a switch from the previous MMORPG's on the market try this game.

[[Thick]] and [[well]] [[built]]: I [[bought]] this for my 2006 Chevy Trailblazer. The smaller one is just a few inches too short - as it gets used it will eventually slide out from under the sunvisors.But the jumbo one is just the right height. Except it's too wide.

Disappointing: Sorry, but pretty much a waste of time and money. Disjointed, repetitive. Last section of book all fluff and filler. Writer denigrates virtually everyone involved in Afghanistan operations, except the Green Berets. Never misses a chance to say something nasty about non SOF personnel or organizations. He is very positive about President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld, but infers that Gen Tommy Franks is an ... I believe events have proven him incorrect about Franks, and history will prove his coverage of the conflict superfluous.

Not that great.: I bought this light from Walmart for about 15 dollars.First of all the headlight is large and nothing about it says sleek, but I didn't let that bother me. After some manipulation (it wasn't quite as easy as the instructions made it out to be) I got both lights mounted and running.The taillight has so far been great. It's quite visible and has many different flash patterns.Unfortunately, the head light isn't as bright as the tail lights. Plus, five minutes into my third use (my night rides were no longer than 30 minutes tops), it went out. I got home and discovered that the light had caused my new batteries to explode, and now the light is no good whatsoever.It's not a total waste, as the rear light is fantastic, but overall I would say that it is a waste of money. I'll be investing in a better headlight.

This no longer fits him but it fits my young argus monitor pretty well, but i will never trust this on him. I think the harness was orginally meant for having you lizard on your SHOULDER just beacasue how short the string is and how the string is so fat and heavy, but for a good reason. Lizards should not be %100 trusted in these, My bearded Dragon was able to escape from this like 4 times out of about 50. He never left, he just wanted out of the thing, and yes, it was secured to him properly. The fat string on this item is probably the thing i hate most, It is all fine and good untill it starts to fray with regular use. This catches on the lizards claws and makes it very difficult for the lizard and the owner.

Also, it can freze at random times too and i have to take the battery out. You also have to hold the on button for literaly 5 seconds! And it only plays mp3, so i have to downloade free softwear to convert wma or wav to mp3. If this unit just worked how its supposed to it would be good for money, but it doesnt.

Got up early in the morning to read them and stayed up late trying to finish them. So, I was really excited when I saw another Sandra Brown book on my bookcase that I hadn't read yet. I liked the first paragraph. After that, it went downhill fast. It seemed like she pumped this book out way too fast. It was too simple. The dialogue, the characters, everything was a flop. I had myself believing that I could have done a better job writing this than her.

The brackets do not extend away from the wall very far, so the tilt is minimal. Will re-mount our tv in the future with a different bracket.

Not much of a legacy: What a slow, dull, plodding book!For what it's worth, and that ain't much, the story concerns Indy's adventures in the American deserts, bookended by French mountains and Italian streets, as he hunts down a Unicorn horn that has magical powers. Yes, they really have sunk THAT low when trying to think of enchanting MacGuffins for our hero to go after.There are double crosses, and some extremely unexciting 'action' scenes, and a whole load of nothing else. I often think that Rob MacGregor's Indy stories have about 10 pages worth of mileage that he e-x-p-a-n-d-s to 300 or so with lots of filler and padded dialogue. It's such an infuriatingly boring read. The high-flying escapades we're used to seeing in the movies is a million miles from this cure for insomnia.For absolute hardcore Indy fans only, and even they won't enjoy it.

Scary but probably true: I used to work for a major IQ test publisher and can say that -- assuming the data here is true -- this seems to be a balanced assessment of how our country is being stratified according to intelligence. The author doesn't say that is correct, merely that it is happening. One of the [[best]] parts of the book is the discussion of possible societal implications in the back.

Is there a better book to demonstrate that literature written by dead white males can be completely captivating, extraordinarily wise about the ways of the world, wonderfully revealing of of human nature, instructive of history in a way a standard text rarely is, exquisitely written, and fully capable of instilling a love of literature to last a lifetime?I suppose the book is too French (the American educational system will admit a Fijian sooner than it will a Frenchman).

DEATH ROW is a goofy, rather [[dull]] spooker, with the typical victims and the ghouls who love them. Actually, there are some well-done gore fx, which are worth an extra star. [[However]], I just didn't [[find]] this one to be all that chilling, original, or [[fun]]. The usually reliable Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) was pretty lame as the main badguy, the ghostly inmates look ridiculous for the most part, and the other characters are pure wood-products. The basic story is an [[ancient]] one that's been done a zillion times before in (better) films like HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, DEAD BIRDS, SCARECROWS, BELOW, etc., and didn't need another re-tread...

not possible/ not worth it: what are they counting for 10 cups capacity ( sugar ).. This is no way worth $50.00 plus food processor.. I purchased this food processor because the Hamilton beach large capacity food processor that I had for almost 2 years finally broke,, (now that was a powerhouse for the same price range as this one) This chefprep,, oh my I can't believe they asking $50.00 plus for it so cheap nothing to this food processor no weight , no power.. you will have to do a lot of your own pre cutting, wont last long if you need it for denser food.. Making salad fixings is probly the best job for this model.. Note to user the food processor has no weight to it, rocks and tips easily during use, the lid doesn't lock and easily during use comes unlocked ... Not worth the money,, there is much better products out that can do a better job...

Really disappointing: For something this fanciful to work, every element, from the characters to the plot to the setting, has to contribute to the suspension of disbelief. None of this took place. The characters were cardboard, the plot meandered, the background was hazy. I will still try to slog through it just because I always try to finish books, but this one's going to take me a while. Sorry, didn't work for me.A note on how I read, and how I review:When they begin to bore me, or I stop believing in the world the writer is attempting to create, I stop reading and move on to something else. There are so many books, and so little time, that it's simply not worth spending time on books that aren't getting the job done. If the book isn't holding your interest, why bother?

it's a toy: Bostitch does not have a customer review section, that should tell you a lot. The compressor comes with a 1 year warranty. Mine quit just after a year with very light usage. I tore it apart. The 1.3HP motor should not have a ratting of more than 1/8 HP, no heat dissipation, very little fan cooling and then only when running. Just as it needs the most cooling when finishing a compress cycle the fan cooling quits. The motor has PLASTIC bushings! The Max.ambient operating temp. is 94'F. The over temp protection is very cheap and unreliable, mine took over 3 days to reset! The motor has just barely enough power to build enough pressure to shut the motor off from the pressure switch. The diaphragm pump is undersized as well, the last 10 pounds of pressure takes about as long to build as the initial 115 pounds. SAVE YOUR MONEY, this is a way under-designed product, not worth the money at any price.

We love Pampers in our house.: My son, now 15 months old, has been wearing Pampers since he was only days old, first the Swaddlers and now Cruisers. I have always liked that they seem softer and more clothe-like than Huggies. They also seem to fit him better too - he is on the slim side. Perhaps they are more expensive than other brands, but personally, I have found it worthwhile to spend a bit more to get a comfortable diaper that fits well. Plus, I love ordering them from Amazon and having them delivered to my door. Much better than having to lug them home from the store!

This cd is an insult to my taste in good music: Are you all tone deaf? It appears so, because in my opinion Steve can not carry a tune. I'm not trying to be ugly, but facts are facts. This man, in my opinion, doesn't have a place in this particular music. If you insist that he is T-H-A-T great singer, then maybe we can work a deal for you to buy my bridge. I have a bridge that I will sell cheap. Would you like to buy my bridge?I think Steve would fit in better under the country music umbrella. His is the right voice for country.As far as repertoire goes, this cd has a great selection.Here again the band failed, just like in the first cd. The band didn't hold up it's part of the bargain by playing romantic chords.This cd is a diaster!

[[Horrible]] Hair [[Dryer]]: I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush. I have never been [[so]] disappointed in a "salon quality" hair dryer. I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry. I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home. I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now. If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full [[refund]]. I feel like I was duped. The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways. It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer. I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them. Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great [[publicist]], but the [[product]] [[falls]] [[short]].

The approach to riding was certainly unusual, but I found none of the images helpful in any way, and in fact if you follow her images closely, you will end up riding incorrectly, as is apparent by the incorrect position seen in many of the pictures throughout the book. She falls into the common trap of thinking riding is about relaxing and balancing, rather than a highly athletic endeavor that requires strong isotonic contractions of many muscles, primarily the abs and thigh muscles.

Easy Rider is the [[best]] [[movie]] that was [[made]] before I was born: This movie is about two guys who get a lot of money from a drug deal and decide to take a tour of America on two Harley Davidson motorcycles circa 1969. They get into a lot of adventures that include meeting a hick Jack Nickolson. This movie was wierd and that is why I liked it so much. It wasn't wierd in a [[dumb]] way. It made you think. Not a lot of movies do that to me, but this one did. The movie had a message when it was released for it's time. Now it's just a [[great]] movie. This movie has lots of grass smoking and an acid trip and they did it all in a cool way. Not blatantly like some movies do with drugs.

[[From]] Jimmy Hendrix to The Byrds they have a lot of killer rock tunes.

Amerivoice is false advertising, theft of service: Amerivoice has falsely advertised "unlimited service" and is ripping off consumers. I had this for 1-1/2 years but now they are strictly enforcing time limits. Did work good and quality was excellent but now its only a block of 1200 minutes per month for $29.95, not unlimited. They are monitoring all your calls on spreadsheets, as soon as you go over the allottment they will e-mail you a 5-day cancellation notice unless you renew and confirm service at 3.9 cents per minute. Obviously Amerivoice can no longer fulfill the unlimited long distance service that was advertised in media and on packaging at Office Depot, Costco. Amerivoice should be at top of the list for FTC enforcement action as well as a class action lawsuit. Sprint and SBC now both offer true unlimited long distance for an additional $20 per month as part of local phone packages, a much better and cheaper choice

Retractable cord [[broke]] after 2 months!: The hairdryer works just fine. I've used a Conair product for years before it finally died and this is the replacement model I purchased mid December of 2007.

But [[worse]] yet, the retractable cord broke after only 2 months of [[use]]. Now it is permanently retracted and I can't seem to unjam it. That means I can't pull the power cord out and therefore can't use the [[dryer]]. What a [[piece]] of [[junk]]! [[Of]] course the 2 year warranty [[asks]] you to mail this heavy sucker back and then pay $5 to cover shipping back to you. Meanwhile, the hairdryer is only $20... you do the math. Another fault is that the lettering on the dryer (high, low, hot, cool, etc) [[rubs]] off within days. Not a big deal, but another [[cheap]] factor. I'd still [[buy]] Conair, just not the retractable cord version.
